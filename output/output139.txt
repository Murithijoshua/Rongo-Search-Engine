These choices, including how to frame stories and carefully choosing which words are used, create an atmosphere conducive to peace and supportive of peace initiatives and peacemakers, without compromising the basic principles of good journalism. (Adapted from Lynch/McGoldrick, Peace Journalism). Peace Journalism gives peacemakers a voice while making peace initiatives and non-violent solutions more visible and viable.To learn more about the basics of PJ, including some key principles and how PJ can be used in daily reporting, you can download our 2-page brochure, “Peace Journalism: An Introduction.”About the Center for Global Peace JournalismThe Center for Global Peace Journalism at Park University promotes the concepts of peace and peace journalism.
