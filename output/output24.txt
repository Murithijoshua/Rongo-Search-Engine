Self Sponsored Programmes and Distance Education 



Distance Education 




Rongo University offers ‘Distance Learning’ mode of delivery intended to favour those students who may not be available to take courses either on full time or part time (evenings and weekends) basis. Currently, the following courses are being offered by distance learning mode:-Bachelor of Education (Arts), Bachelor of Education in Early Childhood and Primary Education, Bachelor of Education in Special Needs Education, Bachelor of Arts in Sociology, Criminology and Community Development 




Deferment 




An applicant who for any reason is unable to take up the offer of admission will be required to inform the Registrar, Academic Affairs by either filling in the non acceptance form of the joining instructions or writing directly to the Registrar, Academic Affairs.  This information should reach the Registrar, Academic Affairs at least one week prior to the date of registration.  An applicant will be required to apply to defer admission on an annual basis but after the second year the offer of admission will lapse and the applicant will be required to re-apply afresh for admission.  It is important that an applicant who defers admission ensures that he or she receives an official letter of deferment of admission from the Registrar, Academic Affairs.  An applicant who fails to inform the Registrar, Academic Affairs of his/her deferment of admission will be deemed to have forfeited his/her position and will be deregistered from the course admitted to.Continuing Students who for one reason or the other are unable to carry on with their studies on financial, medical or other justifiable reasons as stipulated in the University Rules and Regulations will also be expected to submit a duly filled deferment form to the Registrar, Academic Affairs and thereafter receive a letter allowing them to defer their studies for one academic year renewable once. 




Leave of Absence 




A student who for justifiable reasons wishes to be out of the University for a few days not exceeding three weeks may request for leave of absence from the University through the Dean of Students who will consider the request in consultation with the relevant offices and grant permission as he deems fit. The permission granted must be copied to the Dean of School where the applicant resides.

Change of programme for newly registered GSSP students shall be undertaken at the beginning of the second week of the first semester by affected students filling in the Inter/intra-School Transfer Form and submitting to the Office of the Dean of the School where they are registered in and forwarded to the School they intend to join for recommendation.As you navigate the Academic Division’s Website, it is my hope that you will be able to get relevant information.
