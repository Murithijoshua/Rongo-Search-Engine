What students say 










 













 




						From the minute I arrived, I was treated with the utmost empathy, kindness and respect… I have nothing but praise for the care I received as a patient at the Clinic. I cannot believe how i was treated with that same level of care, encouragement, support, positive reinforcement, kindness and respect that I received at the University Clinic					


						Omondi Dennis					













 













 




						The amazing devotion of your nurses and staff was the biggest contribution in facilitating my speedy recovery. The expertise of your professionals, combined with genuine warmth and a cheerful attitude, helped alot. I was treated with respect and dignity and attention was paid to all aspects of my physical and emotional needs.
