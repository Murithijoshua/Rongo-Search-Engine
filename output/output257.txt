Organized criminal gangs in Kenya



There has been a sharp increase in the number of organized crime in the country in recent years. These outlawed criminal groups operate in diverse regions in the entire country. There is no doubt at all that the criminal activities these groups are engaged in have deleterious consequences on our society.  It causes fear and desperation in the lives of law-abiding citizens.  The study profiled 46 organized criminal gangs that engaged in extortion, illegal levies, violence, hire for revenge, executions, illegal oathing, promoting hatred, burglary, drugs, theft, murder, human trafficking, trafficking of weapons, cattle rustling, murder, hire by businessmen/politicians for protection or intimidation of opponents, evictions, among others. Organized Criminal Gangs in Kenya 2012
