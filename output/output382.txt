what is art of storytelling?Â 

 
This year we were joined by two award-winning author / illustrator duos to celebrate children’s books and the power of reading for Art of Storytelling. Art of Storytelling started as a capstone event for African Library Project’s new youth fundraiser, Together We Read!. Rallying the support and passion of readers like you, we were able to speak one-on-one with Victoria Jamieson and Omar Mohamed, co-authors of When Stars Are Scattered, and Kevin Heneks and Laura Dronzek, who gave us a preview of their new picture book Sun Flower Lion.
