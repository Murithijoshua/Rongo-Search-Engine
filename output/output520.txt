ASSESMENT OF STONE CRUSHING CHARACTERISTICS AND DEVELOPMENT OF A STONE CRUSHER FOR SMALL SCALE ENTREPRENEURS.






 By admin22





ABSTRACT.
In Civil Engineering and Construction Industry, crushed stones are known as aggregates and are the basic materials in modern construction work. The current methods for crushing stones to produce aggregates are characterized by the use of large, expensive and centralised crushing plants, which are beyond the reach of small scale entrepreneurs. In addition, such centralized plants are often located too far away from the point of use of aggregates leading to prohibitively high cost of the same.
