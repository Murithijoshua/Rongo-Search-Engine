Our vission 




To be a spiritually mature church member who is totally committed to God, Christian principle sand values and is deeply rooted in divine truth and united in Christ mission with the support of the clergy laity and members. 










Our Mission 




To make disciples of all by communicating the everlasting gospel in the context of the three Engels message of Rev 14 : 6 – 12 by immersion baptism ; leading them to accept Jesus as personal savior; uniting them with the remnant church; DISCIPLINE them to serve Him as lord and preparing them for his soon return. 










FUNDERMENTAL BELIEFS 




These are Christ centered believes, and doctrine which is the root of Adventist faith (Jesus Christ) the other and finisher of our faith. They reveal the love of God which  finds its focus at Calvary where mercy and truth have meat together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other ( Psalms 85:10). ‘The bible and the bible alone’ is the only creed of the Adventist.
