Our removals' history and services
As Southern Africa’s oldest furniture removals company, Stuttaford Van Lines has been trusted as the ultimate mover for families and businesses for over a century and a half. Dating back to the mid-1800s when it delivered furniture for Cape Town’s first department store, Stuttaford Van Lines has since evolved into a modern, multi-national moving company with the largest fleet and network in Southern Africa. Having become a household name in the removals industry, Stuttaford Van Lines guarantees a level of care and expertise that cannot be compared. Read more...

Apart from being an expert removal company when it comes to national and international moves, we also provide secure long and short term storage and special items like moving grand pianos or works of fine art. Additionally, you are able to take advantage of specialist services that many removal companies do not offer - such as vehicle and pet relocation.
We understand that the difficulty in moving is not only related to moving all your possessions from one place to the next, but also has to do with the stress of settling into a new city or country. Our customised relocation services will assist you in getting acquainted with the area you are moving to and the facilities available, finding a home and finding the right school, amongst many others. We can also assist you in getting your work permit. All of these extras are just some of the many ways in which we endeavour to make your move as seamless as possible.
Although our removal company is the largest in Southern Africa, we are aware of the value of specialisation, and focus on providing the small family business brand of service that our customers have come to expect. By listening to our clients, understanding their needs and providing a complete range of flexible and technology-based furniture removal services, Stuttaford Van Lines is setting service standards on a worldwide scale.
