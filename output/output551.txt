Bachelor of Laws (L.LB)
Course code – G34
Our premise is that the study of law should inculcate in students the requisite knowledge, skills and attitudes for a broad range of theories and practice areas. This proceeds from the fact that law is a contextual discipline informed by the social, economic, political and cultural context in which it operates. Indeed, law always interacts, is shaped by, and in turn shapes, the context in which it operates. This contextual nature of law will inform our teaching.

Doctor of Philosophy in Environmental Policy

In a world fractured by the effects of environmental degradation, political turmoil, economic crises and chronic famine it is self-evident that cultures of peace depend on good governance and equitable access, utilization and distribution of natural resources. Transformative leaders and change agents with a multidisciplinary practical knowledge on resource economy, policy, legal pluralism, community mobilization skills and appropriate participatory approaches are required to assist communities in sustainable utilization of resources as well as develop policy and generate research data that would guide integrated environmental management. In response to needed human capacity in this area, the institute has developed a multidisciplinary and experiential learning program in peace and environmental studies.
