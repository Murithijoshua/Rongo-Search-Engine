Project Communication and Perceived Project Performance:The Mediating Influence of Individual Commitmentin Uganda’s Citizenship Projects
ABSTRACTThis paper examines the mediating influence of individual commitment on the relationship between project communication and perceived project performance. Many citizenship projects frequently fail to deliver on time, budget, specifications, and quality or do not deliver value to the public. This could be attributed to ineffective project communication and lack of individual commitment. Despite previous research contributions, no existing studies have investigated the mediating influence of individual commitment on this relationship. Thus, empirical research to corroborate these claims in this area remains anecdotaland scanty. Based on a cross sectional data set from 322 citizenship project stakeholders in Uganda used to validate the theoretical model, findings reveal that individual commitment elements (affectivity, normative and continuance) significantly mediate the relationshipbetween project communication and perceived project performance. The results also suggest that affectivity and normative commitment have 2 Arthur Ahimbisibwe; Sudi Nangoli and Wilson Tusiime ORSEA Journal a stronger influence towards perceived project performance thancontinuance commitment. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.
