What I will learn and how I will be assessed
Learn about PR planning principles, media relations techniques and the impact of social media on PR practice.
You will master the art of writing for different channels too – from press releases to blogs and social media posts.
The syllabus is made up of three separate units:

Unit 1 looks at the role of PR in organisations and society and developing PR plans.
Unit 2 focuses on the creation and management of communication that works, including traditional and digital communication methods.
Unit 3 considers the ethical aspects of PR and how the success of PR activities can be judged.

To gain the qualification, you will need to successfully complete each of the three assessments.
Course duration
The entire programme will involve 48 hours of tuition. There are 4 assessment sessions per year. Depending on when you enroll on to the qualification you could qualify in as little as 6 months.
