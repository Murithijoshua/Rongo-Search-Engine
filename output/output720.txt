HELB CERTIFICATE CHECKER

The checker confirms validity of certificates issued by HELB to beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries.

Clearance certificates can be obtained at the HELB offices upon completion of loan repayment.
To generate a compliance certificate, one is required to sign up at this portal by clicking on User Registration.
