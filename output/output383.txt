How we create Libraries in Africa
All it takes to create a single library for students in need is 1000 gently used childrenâs books and $500 toward shipping.
In the United States, our volunteers collect, sort, and pack gently used childrenâs books and raise modest funds to ship each library.Â Hosting a book drive is a fun and engaging way to make a positive impact with your friends, family, and co-workers!
We match each book drive with a specific African school or community in need.Â Each school or community is required to provide the space, bookshelves and staffing for the library, which encourages sustainability. They also specify the kinds of books needed for greatest impact.Â  Over the course of their project, U.S. book drive organizers learn more about the African country and communities they are impacting.

Â We are still accepting book drive registrations! However due to the COVID-19 epidemic, these dates are tentative, but we will give you plenty of notice if we change the deadline. We are currently seeking active book drive organizers to collect 500 to 1000 gently used children’s books to start libraries in various countries in Africa.

5-step overview of a successful book drive

 
 
 




 

Step 1: Register and Plan the Perfect Book Drive

Register for a book drive by clicking Take Action
Identify places where you can find books
Spread the word about your book drive
Brainstorm how to fundraise about $500 for shipping
Learn about your school match and the African nation and community you’ll be contributing to

 
 
 




 

Step 2: Collect and Sort Your books

Figure out the types of books you’ll need to collect
Create collection opportunities in convenient locations
Strive to collect books that are culturally diverse and representative
Be creative and keep people updated on your progress
Sort your book donations (as you go) using our Book Drive Guidelines and Do and Don’t list

 
 
 




 

Step 3: Pack Your Books Carefully

Gather the recommended packing materials
Keep count of the number of books packed in each box
Pack your boxes securely and to a weight of no more than 40 pounds each
Affix your African Library Project mailing labels

* The mailing label and packing slip will be provided by your container manager. Â 
 
 
 




 

Step 4: Mail, Donate, and Leave the Rest to Us

Mail your boxes using US Postal Service Media Mail (this can cost up to $400 depending on postal rates)*
Send the remaining $250 as an international shipping donation to us
Email your book drive summary stats
Celebrate! You did it. Stay tuned for updates about your books and be sure to follow us on social media.

*Note: A typical library of 1000 mostly paperback books will weigh about 400-500 pounds and can cost $250 or more.Â  A library of more than 1,000 books or comprised of a lot of heavy, hardcover books will increase mailing costs. Â

Success Stories
 
 
 
 
 





“Being part of the African Library Project for the past six years has taught me so much: about the African countries and communities it serves, about the various ways of being a leader, and about myself and my own capabilities. The book drive process increased my confidence and my ability to speak up for my own values; it gave me the satisfaction of knowing that my team’s hard work was having such a tangible impact and brightening so many students’ futures. Furthermore, as an incredibly transparent, communicative organization, ALP gave me all the support and resources I needed to plan and carry out this rewarding process. I could not have asked for a better organization to guide me through my first experience of leading a team.” 
- Divya Prakash

 
 


âAs a contributor of the African Library Project, I have learned so much from public speaking, to learning how to advertise a book drive. ALPâs network of staff and volunteers are incredibly supportive and continuously dedicated to providing us the resources needed to organize book drives. I am so lucky to be a part of this mission and I would encourage anyone to take part in the ALP.âÂ
