Promoting African Childrenâs Literature

African Library Project is proud to do its part in expanding access to books in Africa one library at a time. However, we know that tackling this issue requires supporting the growth of local publishing within Africa.
We also believe children in the United States equally benefit from having access to more African literature. To shine a spotlight on these efforts, here are some African literary partners we are proud to support!
