Welcome to The National Crime Research CentreThe National Crime Research Centre (NCRC) is a State Corporation under The Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government established by an Act of Parliament, the National Crime Research Act 1997 CAP 62 Laws of Kenya.
The Centre is mandated to carry out research into the causes of crime, its prevention and to disseminate the research findings and recommendations to Government Agencies concerned with the administration of criminal justice, NCRC’s stakeholders and the public. The establishment of NCRC is in line with the International best practice where research has provided critical information on what works to impact on crime and disorder and has helped to generate programmes that can assist Agencies in the criminal justice system.
