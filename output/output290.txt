YOUNG RESEARCHERS  PROGRAMThe NCRC Young Researchers’ Programme is a mentorship and experience building programme for the Centre’s young external research resource persons and students studying relevant degree courses with components of research in the Humanities and Social Sciences to grow their interest and experience in research processes.
This entails research concept/proposal development; data collection; serialization of collected data; data cleaning, coding, entry and analysis; writing of crime research issue/policy briefs and reports; and publication of crime statistics.
Therefore, the programme creates knowledge horizon and efficiency among researchers who are in the Centre’s database and those who are pursuing relevant courses at various universities with a view of forming a critical mass in research. This programme positions the Centre as a premier public institution that encourages growth of knowledge in crime research and criminal justice in Kenya.
The mode of delivery of the Programme includes:

Research processes practical sessions conducted at the Centre by Centre’s experienced Research Staff, scholars and practitioners in the Governing Council, other NCRC-invited experienced scholars and practitioners in the criminal justice system and Centre’s senior and experienced external research resource persons.
Outreach crime research thematic presentations/discussions conducted in universities by Centre’s experienced Research Staff, scholars and practitioners in the Governing Council, other NCRC-invited experienced scholars and practitioners in the criminal justice system and Centre’s senior and experienced external research resource persons.
