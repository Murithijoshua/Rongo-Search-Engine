Research Conference 


























Prof. Z. Ngalo Otieno-Ayayo


 Chairman, Organizing Committee 
 






 









Message from the Conference Organising Committee Chair 



It is with great joy that we welcome this very noble season when Rongo University Community invites faculty members, graduate students, and collaborators in Research and Development from the academia and research organisations to showcase output in research, innovations and patents, under the auspices of the 3rd Rongo University International Multidisciplinary Research Conference. This year’s theme, Refocusing Research and Development to Deal with Emerging Global Challenges resonates well with the impacts of COVID- 19 pandemic and the world’s economic status.
We are aware that many questions relating to the pandemic and other global challenges will remain unanswered, but our research community will mitigate the negative impacts and take advantage of the emerging opportunities to make the world a better place to inhabit. Due to the pandemic, this year’s conference will be a blend of virtual and face-to-face presentations. The venue will be Rongo University main campus, located on the gold-rich Kitere Hills. During the conference, The International Research Journal of Rongo University ( IJORU) will be officially launched.
 















3rd International Multidisciplinary Research Conference- 2021​ 










The gold mines of knowledge at Rongo University erupted 11th-14th October 2021, showcasing knowledge, research and innovation deposits shared with various research and development institution across the world. The event, which was officially flagged of by Rongo University Vice Chancellor Prof. Samuel Gudu accompanied by his two deputies, Profs. Agustino Onkware and Stanley Shitote, culminated in the launching of the International Research Journal of Rongo University (IJORU). This is an open access peer reviewed research journal, which will publish original multidisciplinary  work from all corners of the world. The launching of the journal was conducted by Prof. J.B. Okeyo-Owuor who is in charge of Research and Extension at Rongo University and Prof. Z. Ngalo Otieno-Ayayo, coordinator of Rongo University Annex and chairman of Rongo University conference committee.
 The twin events will provide a platform to chaperon and mentor young researchers. This was confirmed by among others, a fourth year student presenting his research work.

2nd International Multidisciplinary Research Conference​ 










 











Rongo University held its debut International Multidisciplinary Conference between 6th and 9th March 2018 under the chairmanship of Prof. Ernest Sangai Mohochi. This came as a result of consultations with various stakeholders in the academia, industries and research-oriented organisations, which felt there was a gap in research communication and technology transfer that needed to be filled urgently. It will be remembered, for example, that in the recent past in eastern Africa, it was not mandatory for graduate students to publish and/or present their works in research conferences before they graduated. During the same periods in time, academia in the developed world had already seen these needs and had them in their academic policies. Read More
