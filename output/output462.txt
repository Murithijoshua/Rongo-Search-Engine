As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our servicesWhat we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our servicesContent in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content that you find in our services – whether that content belongs to you, Google or othersIn case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights that you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms.Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy.

For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.Develop, improve and update Google servicesWe’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements or addressing security and operability issues.

That’s why the law allows us to limit certain liabilities – but not others – under these terms.These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. These terms don’t limit liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or death or personal injury caused by negligence or willful misconduct.Other than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable service-specific additional terms, subject to applicable law.For business users and organisations onlyIf you’re a business user or organisation:To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll indemnify Google and its directors, officers, employees and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or breach of these terms or service-specific additional terms. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs and legal fees.If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.Google won’t be responsible for the following liabilities:loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill or anticipated savingsindirect or consequential losspunitive damagesGoogle’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) US$500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breachTaking action in case of problemsBefore taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action and give you an opportunity to fix the problem, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:cause harm or liability to a user, third party or Googleviolate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s ordercompromise an investigationcompromise the operation, integrity or security of our servicesRemoving your contentIf we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content and content that infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights.Suspending or terminating your access to Google servicesGoogle reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policieswe’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court orderwe reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party or Google – for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others or scraping content that doesn’t belong to youFor more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this Help Centre page. If you believe that your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time.

These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, region or other place of residence.About these termsBy law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these Terms of Service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or organisations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our services. But not all the services mentioned may be available in your country.If these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that service.If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.If you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business – for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory or security reasons or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we'll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements.
