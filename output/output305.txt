			CCPO VALIDATION WORKSHOP		
On 21st January 2020, PACS joined various stakeholders to validate the Child Care and Protection Officers Program (CCPO) Training Module 1 at a workshop in Nairobi. The CCPO program was started in 2009 to enhance the coordination of Juvenile Justice Agencies for better treatment and care of child offenders. This was after a survey was conducted among the agencies to assess the knowledge and skills of officers in handling child offenders. The workshop aimed at revising the first Module, which draws its guidelines from various Juvenile Justice Agencies and international instruments for eventual implementation.
