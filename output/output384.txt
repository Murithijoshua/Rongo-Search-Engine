Welcome to the Northern California Peace Corps Association!








NorCalPCA events and COVID 19


Update! We are slowly returning to in-person events with the NorCal PCA! All in-person events must follow county health guidelines. Continued virtual events are welcome, for those who do not wish to interact in person quite yet.
 
Were you evacuated?
We have created a page dedicated to highlighting resources and support options for evacuated volunteers.

 What We Do
 












Member Support Services
You can join NorCalPCA's new Social Groups enabling you to meet fellow RPCVs whether you are looking for a job, a house, or just a new friend! We run mentoring programs that help you readjust to life after Peace Corps or prepare for Peace Corps service if you have yet to depart, and we maintain a  job board and organize career, networking, and community building events throughout the year!





Third Goal Programs
You will have plenty of opportunity to share your Peace Corps experience with others through programs such as Speakers Match, our annual Festival of Cultures event, or regional Storytelling events!





Volunteering
NorCalPCA members actively continue the tradition of service stateside after returning home. Opportunities to get together and give back arise frequently, both within the association and with organizations outside of the association.  Check our events calendar to see what volunteers are organizing this month, or sign up to the NorCalPCA volunteer list and we'll reach out to you with opportunities you're interested in. 





Advocacy
You can make a difference! Join NorCalPCA's advocacy efforts to help and improve funding for the Peace Corps and advocate for changes in how Peace Corps serves its volunteers!





Grants
Apply for a NorCalPCA grant to support your community development project in the states or abroad!
