The Delivery of Community-based Sentences in Kenya: The Case of Community Service Orders in Kenya 
The study sought to establish the extent of utilization of Community Service Orders in the country. The findings showed that Law Courts were utilizing prison sentencing more than CSO sentencing for petty offences attracting short prison sentences of less than 2 years thus contributing to prison congestion. For instance, of the 118,343 petty offenders in 2016, at least 80,614 (that is, 68.1%) were committed to serve less than 2 years’ prison sentences and only 37,729 (that is, 31.9%) were committed to serve upto 3 years CSO sentences.Summary report of the Delivery of Community-based Sentences in Kenya:The Case of Community Service Orders in Kenya report
