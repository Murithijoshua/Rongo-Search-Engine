Masculinity and intimate partner violence in Kenya: Male voicesViolet Kirui2019-12-04T09:14:58+00:00


Masculinity and intimate partner violence in Kenya: Male voices
Kenya has recently witnessed an epidemic of intimate partner killings with over 40 women and 5 men killed by a current or ex-partner in the first half of 2019. Prior to these alarming statistics, it was already recognized that intimate partner violence (IPV) is common and normalized. This study explored men’s perceptions about intimate partner violence and masculinity and the potential areas for intervention. The study findings pointed out that the individual risk factors underlying male perpetrators of intimate partner violence were: envy/jealousy; mental disorders; uncontrolled anger by men. Societal risk factors associated with male perpetration of intimate partner violence were found to be ‘threatened man position in the society’; poor parenting; internet/ technology; lack of respect for the marriage institution and breakdown of social/societal norms respectively.
