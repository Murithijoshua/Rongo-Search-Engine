Our perspective on CrimeCrime-admin2018-01-16T20:53:09+00:00

Our perspective on CrimeThe provision of public safety is one of the leading functions of the public service and successful performance in this role requires a strategic approach that involves concerted effort of all stakeholder institutions that have a dimension of security in their mandate. There is no personal crime every crime has a public aspect. The National Crime Research Centre (NCRC) has the overriding objective of carrying out research into the causes of crime and its prevention and to disseminate research findings to Government Agencies charged with administration of criminal justice with a view to assisting them in their policy formulation and planning. Understanding and defining crime in terms of specific threats, therefore, becomes a practical way of appreciating and tackling it.
Indeed, crime and its prevention is quite noticeably the sphere of national security with immediate and commonplace implications for the public. This is because serious and organized crime affects us all. It is a pervasive national security threat with far-reaching effects on the Kenya’s social and economic well-being and international reputation. Its impact can be felt throughout the public and private sectors, undermining communities, destroying lives and costing Kenyans significant amount of monies each year. 
The threat is wide-ranging and complex – spanning everything from malicious software to terrorism – and varies in depth and complexity – from simple frauds to high-end corruption. Its perpetrators are highly innovative and determined in pursuing their goals; our response must be both resourceful and relentless. To inform our response, we require a comprehensive understanding of the risk that crime poses to Kenya. The NCRC as established under the National Crime Research Act No. 4 of 1997 provides the legal framework and draws together that single picture of how the NCRC leads, supports and coordinates the collective national and county response.
While tremendous work has been done to enhance public security and safety, across policing and law enforcement, the scope and depth of the appreciation of this concern among citizens as well as National and County level public servants is less than can match the magnitude of the challenge. In response to this challenge, as well as leading our own operations, NCRC officers support and collate crime related data into policy briefs to partners who help to deliver criminal justice outcomes, recover assets and prevent and disrupt criminal activity. Partnerships, both domestic and international, bringing together the public and private sectors, academia, charities and society as a whole, are crucial to success.
Whereas, the NCRC has the power to direct policing and law enforcement agencies to furnish the Centre with such information or to produce such documents or records as it deems necessary and relevant to achieve this mandate, we operate under mutual respect that all partners are committed to deliver a lasting detrimental effect on serious and organized crime impacting on Kenya and our regional interests.
