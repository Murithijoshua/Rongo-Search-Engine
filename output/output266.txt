Borderland- related crimes and security threats in KenyaViolet Kirui2019-10-08T09:31:44+00:00

Borderland- related crimes and security threats in Kenya
Boderlands study focused on crimes, offences and security threats around Kenya’s borderlands and mainly facilitated by dynamics of the borders. Kenya has twenty one (21) borderland counties and share borders with Ethiopia, Uganda, Sudan, Tanzania and Somalia. The country also borders the Indian Ocean. This makes it highly susceptible to cross-border crimes and security threats including terrorism, maritime piracy, human/drugs/arms and counterfeit trafficking and cybercrime. Borderland-related crimes and security threats continue to threaten national security. Infographics Borderland Crimes in Kenya 2018
