Boda Boda Motorcycle Transport and Security Challenges in Kenya



Boda boda motorcycle transport has become a popular and entrenched means of transport in both rural and urban areas in Kenya, yet is inadequately regulated giving incentives for risk taking, recklessness and impunity among operators.
The research found a strong connection between boda boda operators, weak regulation and the siege mentality to increased cases of robberies; causing death by dangerous riding; breach of public order; committing murder; kidnapping and abduction; possession and usage of dangerous drugs; rape and defilement; smuggling of illegal firearms and contrabands in Kenya.Info-Graphics of Boda Boda Motorcycle Transport and Security Challenges in Kenya
