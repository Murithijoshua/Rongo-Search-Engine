OUR MISSION







				The mission of ADN is to sustainably serve its constituencies, marketplace, and partners. This is inextricably linked to engaging the African diaspora through an ethics of care, enhancing their well-being in their adopted homelands, and facilitating their strategic involvement in the development of Africa and the communities in which we live.					













 
OUR Vision







				ADN’s vision is to activate capital from the African diaspora and friends of Africa for the development of Africa and communities around the world. We aim to be the global leader in diaspora philanthropy, investment, and innovation.					

























 
OUR IMPACT







				Since our founding in 2010, we have been gradually building a network which permits us to harness the global intellectual capacity of Africans in the Diaspora and friends of Africa in order to promote business and economic development across the continent and the communities in which we live.					

















 
Convened more than 7,500 people on entrepreneurship, investment, innovation, and human capital development.
