Food Science and Technology

 
Food safety and quality is an issue of high priority both nationally and internationally. Initially food safety and quality was thought to be the preserve of the food manufacturing industry. Much has changed as food safety and quality is now described along the food chain from primary production to consumption. The food sector is currently facing strong commercial pressure to provide high quality and safe food products. Hence for firms to survive in the competitive food sector worldwide they must integrate food safety and quality planning in their strategies and future planning. There is clearly an indication of lack of adequate knowledge on the safety measures necessary during primary food production, handling, processing, distribution and preparation by key players along the food chain. However the food sector lacks adequately trained human resource to effectively handle the challenging and emerging issues in food safety. In order to enhance food safety and quality along the entire chain it becomes therefore imperative to enhance capacity

Natural Management 
Bachelor of Science Range Management 
Course Code- A25
In Kenya, rangelands cover over 80% of the country and are home to about 36% of the human population, 50% of the national livestock herd and most of the wildlife and biodiversity. Despite their importance, rangelands in Africa are subjected to human-induced degradation, with 31% of the area estimated to suffer severe loss of productivity. The sources of degradation range from inappropriate cultivation of marginal areas, deforestation to overgrazing. Presently, forest cover is disappearing at the rate of 3.7 to 5 million ha per year, and grazing contributes about 34.5% of the total soil loss in these areas. This has placed the rangelands to be hotspots of ecological vulnerability and desertification. Observed rangeland resource degradation trends is made worse by climate change that has increased the frequency and intensity of droughts, flush floods, as well as, increased livelihood risks for the local communities.
The program will empower the professionals meet emerging socio-economic and environmental challenges as envisaged in government development plans, e. g. vision 2030. Also, the revised course content addresses issues in internationally and nationally recognized conventions and protocols (CCD, CBD, and the Kyoto protocol on climate change) that partly focus on rangelands.

Master of Science in Plant Breeding and Biotechnology
Course code - A518
Plant breeding has for a long time been focused on developing types better suited for satisfying agricultural needs for food and nutrition, and even for clothing, fuel, drugs and aesthetically pleasing ornamentals. Improved materials have led to increased yields, better varieties for new agricultural areas, better agronomic and horticultural characteristics, varieties resistant to heat, cold ,or drought and improved quality of agricultural products. Much has been achieved through classical breeding made possible by the application of Mendelian and statistical genetics. Genetic improvement has taken on a complex dimension of the interrelationships of genes, crops and the environment and/or issues of genetic resources ownership, access and equity. Biotechnology that makes it possible for rapid genetic manipulation brings with it intellectual property concerns. Complete sequencing of several plant genomes has provided immense genetic information that needs to be harnessed to contribute towards improving crops. All these have changed the face of plant breeding with implications on global trade, third world poverty and food security.
the Plant Breeding and Biotechnology programme is thus tailored to remain versatile to the changing times by incorporating industry focused content and modern student centered delivery methods. The programme content and mode of delivery is structured to meet the students’ aspirations and to expose the students to the job market opportunities and the emerging advances in the field of plant breeding, applied genetics and biotechnology
this course aims : To produce graduates with ability to identify research imperatives in plant breeding and biotechnology, design and execute plant breeding research projects aimed at solving the problems within a changing agricultural environment; To train highly skilled plant breeders and plant biotechnologists who will help optimize the country’s ability to attain food security and better nutrition while improving agriculture-based incomes from improved products and maintaining the natural resource base.
