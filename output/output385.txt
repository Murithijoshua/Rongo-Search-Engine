Over the past 25 years, The Palmer Foundation has awarded hundreds of domestic grants to 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations, primarily in Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic states, as well as international grants to worthwhile organizations working in countries where family members have lived. The Palmer Foundation empowers people to reach their highest potential. We strive to be a catalyst for change by funding water access, santitation, and hygiene (WASH) intiatives and preparing youth and adults for quality careers. Our grants are focused on projects that are realistic, impactful, and measurable.
