Past15 years ago, Chris Bradshaw founded the African Library Project (ALP) with little more than an idea and a passion for helping others. She started with the first of many ALP libraries in Lesotho. This is her story.

 

PresentThere is no better representation of our success than our African partners. They work on the ground work to ensure each school that applies for a library gets one. Explore our latest partnership withÂ enjuba, Uganda.

 

futureWe have done so much over 15 years. It’s time to look to the future generation of volunteers and leaders. We asked our young book drive organizers and youth ambassadors where they see our organization 15 years from now.

 
 


 
 



The First African Library Project Library


âThe process was just like a start up. I pulled from my prior experience running nonprofits and learned as much as I could from others.â In the beginning, Chris was collecting and shipping books herself, but she soon realized that wasnât something she could maintain. So she began reaching out to local schools to help with the process and was very encouraged by their enthusiasm for helping and realized she could, âgo from being a book drive organizer to organizing a nonprofit.” – Chris Bradshaw, ALP Founder

Our Newest partner in uganda talks about why access is essential for students

enjubaÂ is African Library Projectâs most recent partner in Uganda. In Uganda, eight of every ten children of 10 years or under cannot read. enjuba is working to help increase the literacy rate in the country by bringing reading into Ugandan culture. One step theyâre taking to do this is their newfound partnership with African Library Project.
âIt is an education organization focused on helping children attain literacy skills to improve school completion rates. We do this through spelling bees, library development and publishing of afro-centric childrenâs books to help children fall in love with books LEARN to READ so they can READ to LEARN,â Aaron Kirunda from enjuba said during an interview with African Library Project.
âI was eager to partner with ALP because it was a sure way of getting relevant books to children and communities in Uganda in ways that no other organization involved in the same activity was doing.”
We are currently working on sending our second container of books to primary schools across Uganda with the help of enjuba. With your support, we can continue spreading our mission across Uganda and similar countries.
