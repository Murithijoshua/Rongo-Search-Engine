WELCOME
Hello, and welcome to Kenyatta University  (KU). 
The Vice-Chancellor of Kenyatta University is Prof. Paul K. Wainaina, Ph.D., Vice-Chancellor
 





History Of Kenyatta University
Founded in 1985, Kenyatta University, the third oldest public university in Kenya, is situated in Kahawa, North East of Nairobi, off the Nairobi-Thika Super-Highway.
The institution is deeply committed to upholding the responsibility that comes with its rich history. As a public institution, KU (as the University is commonly referred to), has always been accessible to qualified persons who desire a good education. We provide our students from diverse local and international backgrounds excellent facilities and high quality programmes that give them a head-start in the world of work as highly skilled personnel and job creators. The facilities include a world-class library, well-equipped science and computer laboratories, sports and games pitches including a tartan athletics field and an Olympic size swimming pool, state-of-the-art language and fine art studios, and the impressive Chandaria Business Innovation and Incubation Centre, where young entrepreneurs with innovative projects are nurtured to scale up their ideas into viable spin-off companies.
Being a dynamic institution, Kenyatta University engages with the community, and is steadily elevating, through research and knowledge application, the quality of lives of people in the society. Kenyatta University is home to some of the world’s best scholars, researchers and experts in diverse fields. We pride ourselves in providing value-adding courses and experiences that complement academic programmes to produce individuals with skills that the global market needs.What gives the KU graduates an edge with their future employers is hands-on knowledge in their particular professions. To adequately prepare students for the dynamic labour market, the University has established meaningful links with leading organizations and industrial partners, who guide the University on practical, professional requirements which need to be built into programmes. With the relevant input from stakeholders, the University’s courses are tailored to equip our graduates with leading edge skills for the workplace. Already, many of our graduates are exposed to new employment opportunities by working on 'live' projects during their study, or through course related placements. The relevance of our programmes is maintained through our ongoing relationships with research organizations, banks, and industrial partners, local and foreign institutions.With a clear policy on internationalization, the University has put in place various programmes such as the Intra-Africa student exchange initiative through which selected KU students study abroad for a whole semester at the partnering institutions. Students from those institutions also undertake their studies at KU for a similar period. Through such active links, staff and students also undertake collaborative research and pursue joint programmes. By educating the next generation of thinkers and doers and leveraging staff and researcher expertise, Kenyatta University continues to drive new ideas and innovations necessary for societal development.
