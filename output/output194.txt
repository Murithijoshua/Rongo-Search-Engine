 Creator Basics: How to Set Up and Customise
 Your Channel
 





 There are a few ways to get started on YouTube. We
 offer up different formats and functionalities,
 giving you the flexibility to create everything
 from Shorts, which are vertical videos that run 60
 seconds or less, to longer form videos.
 

 No matter what you're creating, you'll need to
 start by creating a YouTube Channel.
 


 First you need to sign in to YouTube using a
 Google Account.
 

 Once you're signed in, click 'Create Account',
 and choose whether it's for you or for your
 business.
 

 You can then create a YouTube channel on your
 account, upload videos, leave comments and
 create Shorts and playlists.
 

Next, you'll want to upload your videos!


 Uploading is easy. You just sign in to your
 YouTube account and then click on the 'Create'
 icon.
 

 If you're planning to upload a longer form
 video, select 'upload video' and then choose
 your desired video file â you can upload 15
 files at a time!
 

 If you'd like to
 upload a YouTube Short, you'll need to be signed in to YouTube
 mobile, where you'll tap 'Create' and then
 'Create a Short'. From here you can either
 upload a video from your camera roll or create
 using our suite of lightweight tools.
 



















 Intro to making money on YouTube
 





 There are a few ways for creators to make money on
 YouTube, but most start with becoming a member of
 the
 YouTube Partner Programme (YPP).*
 

 Once accepted, you'll begin to gain access to a
 variety of monetisation products, including a
 share of the Ad and YouTube Premium Revenue
 generated by your videos; Channel memberships;
 merch shelf; Super Chat and Super Stickers; and
 BrandConnect. Each feature has its own performance
 and
 eligibility requirements.
 

 Our newest offering through the YouTube Shorts
 Fund is not limited to creators in the YouTube
 Partner Programme. Anyone is eligible to
 participate by creating unique Shorts that delight
 the YouTube Community. Each month, we'll get in
 touch with thousands of creators with the most
 popular Shorts to reward them for their
 contributions.

 Help Your Videos Stand Out and Keep Viewers
 Watching
 





 Growing your channel is all about creating videos
 viewers want to watch and accurately presenting
 them to the audience. When doing so, here's a few
 tips to keep in mind.
 

 With each video, think carefully about the title,
 description and
 thumbnail
 you plan to use â these should all accurately
 reflect your content and let viewers know what
 they can expect from the video. If you're a Shorts
 creator, think about how the first 1â2 seconds of
 your content can grab viewers scrolling through
 the video feed!
 

 Once you've got viewers watching, you can redirect
 their attention via hashtags,
 playlists,
 cards,
 end screens
 and more.
 


















 The Algorithm
 





 Our search and discovery systems are built to find
 videos that match viewers' individual interests.
 We
 recommend videos
 based on things such as: what your audience
 watches and doesn't watch, how much time they
 spend watching, what they like and dislike, if
 they mark a video as 'not interested' and on
 satisfaction surveys.
 

 So, rather than trying to find a secret code to
 these systems, focus instead on making videos that
 you think will resonate with your audience. A
 great tool here is YouTube Analytics, which
 provides data that can help you understand how
 your existing content is performing and provide
 insights for future videos!
 


















 Secure Your YouTube Account
 





 If you notice that your YouTube account or channel
 has been hacked or compromised, you'll first want
 to check whether or not you can sign in to your
 account.
 

 If you can't sign in to your account, you'll need
 to recover your Google Account by answering some
 security questions to verify it's yours. Then,
 you'll be prompted to reset your password.
 

 To keep your account protected, we also recommend
 turning on 2-step verification, which can be done
 in your security settings.
