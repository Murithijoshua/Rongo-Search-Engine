  Testimonials 






Due to the scholarly environment at Rongo University, transitioning from a student to a professional was timely and accurate. Rongo University taught me not only academic issues, but also how to transform a dystopic society into an egalitarian community by applying both academic and ambassadorial skills.
Indeed, the decision to study at Rongo University was virtuous.



Knowen CosmasGraduate Alumni





I would like to thank the Rongo University fraternity for the extra support provided and mentoring during face-to-face classes and even during the pandemic, where we could reach them remotely. This made us feel welcomed and it projected a united classroom through the e-learning system and other online platforms. .
