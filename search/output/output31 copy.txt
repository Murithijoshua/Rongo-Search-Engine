Make an impact.
The University of Memphis Athletics Department is committed to creating a "Culture
 of Champions" within each of its 19 intercollegiate sports programs. Each year, Tiger
 coaches and student-athletes serve as outstanding ambassadors for our city and our
 University. Your donation to the Tiger Scholarship Fund directly impacts the experiences
 of more than 400 student-athletes at the University of Memphis.
 
Our Mission
The mission of the Memphis Athletics Development Office is to generate funding for
 student-athlete scholarships and improved facilities, as well as to provide general
 support to the University of Memphis Athletics Department. We accomplish these goals
 through the Tiger Scholarship Fund, the True Blue Society and the M Club. This mission
 is achieved by cultivating relationships that encourage private giving from those
 businesses and individuals who share our commitment, passion and vision for Tiger
 Athletics.
