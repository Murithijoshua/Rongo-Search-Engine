 Creative Writing 

Creative Writing
The Undergraduate Creative Writing Program offers the opportunity for students to
 take courses in three areas: poetry, fiction and creative nonfiction. The program
 includes literature courses, forms courses that examine the history of a genre from
 a writer's perspective, and creative writing workshops in fiction, poetry or creative
 nonfiction. The degree offered is a BA in English with a Concentration in Creative
 Writing.
 
In addition to the English Major requirements and electives, Creative Writing students
 must choose 12 hours from the following list following the principles outlined below
 and in the Undergraduate Catalog
 

ENGL 3606 Poetry Writing
ENGL 3607 Fiction Writing
ENGL 3608 Creative Nonfiction Writing
ENGL 4600 Creative Nonfiction Workshop (3608 prerequisite)
ENGL 4601 Poetry Workshop (3606 prerequisite)
ENGL 4603 Fiction Workshop (3607 prerequisite)
ENGL 4610 Creative Writing in Translation (Study Abroad)

Program Notes:

12 Concentration hours must be composed of the following:
 
 
1) 6 hours composed of ENGL 3606 and either 3607 or 3608; and
2) 6 hours of 4000-level workshop courses: 4600, 4601, or 4603.


Students planning to apply for graduate school in Creative Writing should consult
 closely with a faculty advisor in Creative Writing and should plan on taking two or
 more of their 4000-level courses (workshops and forms courses) in a single genre (poetry
 or fiction).
 
In other words, students MUST take 3606 as 3 hours toward the CW concentration total;
 3 hrs of either 3607 or 3608; 6 hours of 4000-level workshop courses: 4600, 4601,
 or 4603.
 
4900, 4996, and 4610 may only be used as English Upper Division electives and cannot
 be used toward the concentration hours.
 
Students must complete English 3606, 3607 and/or 3608 before enrolling in a 4000-level
 workshop (4600, 4601, 4603).
 
Creative Writing workshops (4600, 4601, 4603) may each be taken twice within the concentration.
See the Undergraduate Catalog - English (B.A.)  for a complete list of all degree requirements.
