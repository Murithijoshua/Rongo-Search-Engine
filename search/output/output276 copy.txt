Art – Art Education, B.F.A.
The University of Memphis Department of Art offers a BFA in Art Education and post
 degree licensure options, including an MAT in Art Education. Our programs specialize
 in K-12 instruction for those seeking to teach art in urban and suburban schools with
 diverse student populations.
 
UofM Art Education majors share a passion for art and for teaching. Students are supported
 by a range of creative experiences in studio media, art history, aesthetics and innovative
 teaching methodologies. Quality internships in the local schools help bridge theory
 to practice. Master Art Educators mentor our students to ensure meaningful preparation
 for careers as professional educators.

 and content of quality arts education. Graduates demonstrate competence in a comprehensive
 approach that includes cross-cultural, thematic, and interdisciplinary art curriculum
 development.
