 meeting times or upcoming events.

 email.
 
Attend Events - RSOs hold lots of events throughout the year. Attend an event and
 get to see first-hand what their organization does. You also get to meet members and
 officers of the RSO there.
 
Visit the Involvement Zone - The Involvement Zone at the 2nd floor of the UC hosts
 several offices:
 
 
Student Leadership and Involvement,
Multicultural Affairs,
Adult & Commuter Services,
Student Government Association,
And different RSO offices.


Each office can provide you more information about certain organizations and as well
 as different activities you can do to get involved.
