Medical Assisting (Academic Minor)


Course Requirements
Courses offered by semester

The College of Health Sciences offers a 24-credit-hour minor in Medical Assisting
 available to all students, regardless of major. This program serves students in various
 disciplines who are interested in learning about and/or working within the healthcare
 field. The minor is intended to enrich your current plan of study and provide an opportunity
 to learn valuable skills applicable in the clinical setting.
 
Medical assistants are currently in high demand, with a projected 29% job growth over
 the next 10 years - a much greater rate than the average for all occupations. Medical
 assistants are widely employed in outpatient clinics, medical offices, hospitals,
 nursing homes and other medical establishments. The work that was once performed by
 registered nurses (e.g., medical history, vital signs, phlebotomy, medication administration,
 EKG, etc.) is now often performed by medical assistants who support nurses, nurse
 practitioners, physician assistants and doctors.
 
Coursework in the Medical Assisting minor allows you to obtain the necessary knowledge
 and practical skills needed to sit for the national certification exam in medical
 assisting. If you do not desire to obtain a certificate, the coursework should be
 helpful if you choose to pursue other entry-level healthcare positions for which such
 knowledge and skills may be desired.
 
You may be interested in this minor if you are working part time as a medical assistant
 while completing your undergraduate degree. If you plan to apply to graduate programs
 which require patient contact hours prior to acceptance, this minor may be for you.
 The knowledge and skills gained through the minor coursework help you to become more
 marketable for entry-level healthcare employment opportunities.
 
The 24-hour Medical Assisting minor is very manageable. In particular, if you are
 already required to take Anatomy and Physiology I and II with the labs (8 hours),
 the minor will only require an additional 16 credit hours. For students within the
 College of Health Sciences who are required to take HMSE 2000 (2 hours), the minor
 requires only an additional 14 credit hours.
 
If you secure a certificate in medical assisting or work as a medical assistant, you
 may be eligible for additional Experiential Learning Credit (ELC). Please see this page for additional information. 
 
For more information about the Medical Assisting minor, please contact Tara Hunter, BSN, MS at tmhill@memphis.edu.
