Accelerated Bachelor's/Master's (ABM) Degree
The Accelerated Bachelor's/Master's (ABM) degree program is a B.S. in Sport and Leisure
 Management/M.S. in Sport Commerce. This program allows outstanding undergraduate students
 to begin the coursework for the M.S. in Sport Commerce during their senior year. Students
 are encouraged to begin planning to enter the ABM program early in their undergraduate
 career in consultation with their advisor. Working with the undergraduate and graduate academic
 coordinators, undergraduates selected into this program begin a carefully tailored
 course of study that will allow them to complete their B.S. in Sport and Leisure Management
 degree while also completing coursework toward their M.S. in Sport Commerce degree.
 
To apply, students must maintain a minimum 3.25 grade point average, submit two letters
 of reference, and provide a copy of their academic transcript to the Kemmons Wilson
 School of Hospitality and Resort Management. Each applicant will complete an interview
 with the graduate academic coordinator of the M.S. in Sport Commerce program. To continue
 in the program past the B.S. in Sport and Leisure Management, students must apply
 for full admission to both the Graduate School and the M.S. in Sport Commerce program.
 In the ABM program, up to 9 hours of graduate coursework may be applied to both the
 undergraduate and graduate programs. However, any graduate coursework will not apply
 to a student's undergraduate grade point average.
