The Doctoral Degree Program
The Ph.D. is the highest degree granted by the university; it is conferred only on
 those candidates whose work evidences both general proficiency and the ability to
 perform independent historical research. The degree is never conferred merely for
 the accumulation of credits.
 
The Ph.D. program is designed to prepare you for teaching and research in higher education
 or for a career in government, business, library service, and other research-related
 fields. But be warned: you will need to put in at least four academic years of study
 and research beyond the M.A. degree to complete the program.

 specific aspects of the program. The Ph.D. Program Overview offers a concise look at the steps you will need to take as you move toward degree
 completion.
