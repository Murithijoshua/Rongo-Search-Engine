About the PhD Program in Philosophy
The PhD program is structured to provide a broad background in the history of philosophy
 and in the different contemporary methodologies, and then to proceed to the specialization
 requisite for the dissertation. It is designed to avoid a premature and overly narrow
 specialization and to ensure a competence in the basic fields of philosophy as a foundation
 for subsequent concentration in one or more areas of Continental philosophy, analytic
 philosophy or the history of philosophy. Graduates will thus be prepared to teach
 not only their specialty, but also a wide variety of basic courses, and will be prepared
 to function effectively as teachers and colleagues even in departments in which the
 main focus is in a tradition or methodology different from their own concentration.
 They will also be able to apply their expertise to areas of endeavor outside academia,
 such as law, publishing, medicine, computer design, theology, and secondary education.
 
Students whose objective is a PhD in philosophy at the University of Memphis and who
 satisfy the admission requirements should apply directly to the PhD program. Applicants
 not admitted to the PhD program because of lack of space will be considered for the
 MA program if they indicate their desire to be so considered by marking MA/PhD on
 their application and letter of recommendation forms. Students in the MA program may
 apply for admission to the PhD program.
 
Course Requirements
The aim of the department of philosophy is that each student has an understanding
 of the place of his or her areas of research within the basic areas and methodologies
 of philosophy, including both the analytic and Continental traditions and the common
 historical basis on which they are founded. To foster this aim, the following course
 distribution requirements are included among the requirements for the PhD.
 
Students must take a core consisting of: (a) four courses in the history of philosophy
 (at least one in ancient and one in modern); (b) two courses in metaphysics, epistemology,
 and related areas; and (c) two courses in normative areas of philosophy.
 
Students must take the Proseminar in the fall semester of the first year and Teaching
 Skills in the spring semester of the second year.
 
Assistantships
Several assistantships are available for students in the PhD program. First year students
 serve as graders, tutors, or discussion leaders. After the second year, PhD students
 teach sections of introductory courses. Assistantships are normally for a five-year
 period for students making satisfactory progress toward the degree. Applications received
 after January 5th cannot be guaranteed consideration for an assistantship for the
 fall semester.
 
Further Information
Additional information and guidelines regarding our PhD Program may be found in the
 Graduate Studies Guidebook, or by contacting the Director of Graduate Studies, Dr. Timothy Roche.
