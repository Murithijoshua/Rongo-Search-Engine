 	Masters Overview

Master of Arts Program Overview
The Department of Philosophy offers a comprehensive and balanced program of study
 leading to the degree of Master of Arts in Philosophy. The aim of the program is twofold.
 It is designed to provide comprehensive training in philosophy for students seeking
 work beyond the baccalaureate, as background for such areas as law, theology, psychology,
 and cognitive science, or solely for self-enrichment. For students intending to continue
 their study in a doctoral program, the program also provides the thorough preparation
 necessary for admission to and success in a PhD program.
 
Course Requirements
The program requires 33 semester hours of course work for students who do not write
 a thesis, 30 hours for students who write a thesis. These must include (a) two courses
 in the history of philosophy; (b) two courses from metaphysics, epistemology, and
 related areas; and (c) two courses in normative areas of philosophy.
 
Assistantships
Several assistantships are available for students in the MA program. Assistantships
 are renewed for the second year for students making satisfactory progress in the two-year
 MA program. Applications received after January 5th cannot be guaranteed consideration
 for an assistantship for the following fall semester.
 
Further Information
Additional information and guidelines regarding our MA Program may be found in the
 Graduate Studies Guidebook, or by contacting the Director of Graduate Studies, Dr. Timothy Roche.
