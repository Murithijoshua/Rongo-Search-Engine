UofM receives INSIGHT Into Diversity 2021 Higher Education Excellence in Diversity
 (HEED) Award
 
Sept. 22, 2021 — The University of Memphis was one of 101 recipients of the 2021 Higher Education
 Excellence in Diversity (HEED) Award from INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine, the oldest
 and largest diversity-focused publication in higher education.
 
“This recognition reinforces the University of Memphis’ commitment to our core values
 and that our diversity is a remarkable strength of our University and the broader
 Memphis community,” said UofM President M. David Rudd.
 
“The University of Memphis is immensely proud and honored to be recognized as a Top
 College for Diversity, and we thank INSIGHT into Diversity for acknowledging the hard
 work of our faculty, staff, students, alumni, community and corporate partners,” said
 Dr. Karen Weddle-West, UofM vice president for student academic success/director of
 diversity initiatives.
 
“The HEED award is nationally recognized as the most prestigious honor for excellence
 in diversity, equity and inclusion among institutions of higher learning and is emblematic
 of the University’s commitment to academic excellence via diversity in teaching, research,
 service and student success. Receiving this award during the year that we achieved
 record-breaking graduation rates for all students is particularly rewarding and assures
 that we will continue to work to fulfill the mission and vision of the University.”
 
As a recipient of the annual HEED Award — a national honor recognizing U.S. colleges
 and universities that demonstrate an outstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion
 — the UofM will be featured in the November 2021 issue of INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine.
 
“The HEED Award process consists of a comprehensive and rigorous application that
 includes questions relating to the recruitment and retention of students and employees
 — and best practices for both — continued leadership support for diversity, and other
 aspects of campus diversity and inclusion,” said Lenore Pearlstein, publisher of INSIGHT
 Into Diversity magazine.
 
“We take a detailed approach to reviewing each application in deciding who will be
 named a HEED Award recipient. Our standards are high, and we look for institutions
 where diversity and inclusion are woven into the work being done every day across
 their campus.”
