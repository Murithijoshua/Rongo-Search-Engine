Integrative Studies (BSEd)
Major: Integrative Studies
 
Concentration: Secondary Mathematics Education (grades 6-12)
 
Degree: BSEd
 
Forms: Integrative studies: Secondary Math degree sheet >
At the University of Memphis we take mathematics education seriously.  Our course
 work is designed for students who want to teach mathematics in urban environments. 
 We carefully craft our course work for mathematics teachers in grades 6 through 12
 in conjunction with the department of Mathematical Sciences.
 
Join us if you want to learn how to teach students mathematical concepts as well as
 procedures.  Our classes in secondary mathematics education are closely aligned with
 constructivist theories of learning, we believe that students learn by actively doing
 mathematics instead watching mathematics.  As our students learn how to teach mathematics
 they learn that context matters—mathematics is not a neutral subject it is culturally
 based.
 
We are dedicated to preparing diverse mathematics educators to serve diverse, historically
 marginalized populations.  We do this by teaching our secondary mathematics teacher
 candidates about cultural identities and histories; focusing on social justice and
 equity; and carefully linking theory and practice.  With built in support from our
 mathematics education faculty, the program goals are realized via careful, deliberate
 placements with successful mentor teachers serving high needs students.
 
Join us to make a difference in OUR COMMUNITY.
