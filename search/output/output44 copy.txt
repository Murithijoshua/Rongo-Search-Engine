About the Undergraduate Program
Sociology is the study of social relations in groups, institutions and organizations,
 communities, and entire societies. Why do people in groups interact with each other
 as they do? How do changes in health care services, and the health care industry,
 affect people's quality of life? How do communities organize to fight poverty and
 crime? What are the most important social changes in the U.S. and abroad over the
 last fifty years? How do changes in immigration patterns affect understandings about
 race and ethnicity? What is the significance of race in the twenty-first century?
 Why are there more wars in some world regions than in others? All of these questions,
 and many more, interest sociologists, who use various theories and research techniques
 to study the social problems that affect all of us.
 
If you are interested in the study of society, then sociology may well be the major
 for you. After graduation, sociology majors find employment as teachers, social-service
 workers, business people, health-care professionals, and in many other fields. Sociology
 is also an excellent major if you are planning to enter law school or another professional
 field, including medicine. Of course, some sociology majors enter MA or PhD programs
 in sociology because they want to become professors, professional researchers, or
 even market analysts. In short, sociology prepares people for a broad range of careers.
 
The American Sociological Association has published information on Sociology careers. 
 You can access that information through the following links:

The Department of Sociology, in collaboration with the University Honors Program , offers additional opportunities for undergraduates through course work, special
 topics, freshman forums, individualized research, and honors thesis.
