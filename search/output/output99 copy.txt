 Language and Linguistics

Applied Linguistics
The Applied Linguistics Concentration provides students with the tools necessary to
 investigate language. Students confront the questions, theories, and methods of exploring
 language as a system. In addition to the theoretical nature of language study, students
 explore the real-life implications of language for literature, English as a Second
 Language (ESL), composition, language development, and the social dimensions of language
 and linguistics.
 
In addition to the English Major requirements and electives, Applied Linguistics students
 must choose 12 hours from the following list.
 

ENGL 3501 Modern English Grammar
ENGL 3511 Introduction to Linguistics
ENGL 3521 The American Language
ENGL 4501 History of the English Language
ENGL 4511 Language and Literature
ENGL 4521 Language and Society
ENGL 4522 Gender and Language
ENGL 4540-50 Special Topics in Language and Linguistics

See the Undergraduate Catalog - English (B.A.) for a complete list of all degree requirements.
