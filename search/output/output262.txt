Communication Studies Concentration
WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH A DEGREE IN COMMUNICATION STUDIES?

"Employers send a consistent message about what they look for in a college-educated
 employee: the ability to write clearly, speak persuasively, analyze data effectively,
 work in diverse groups, and understand the competitive global knowledge environment."-Kevin Reilly, President, University of Wisconsin

Employers are looking for graduates who can "think critically, communicate clearly, and solve complex problems." And these are exactly the skills we teach our students. Recent communication studies
 alumni work in account management, corporate communications, development and fundraising,
 human resources, marketing and events planning, non-profit management, and social
 media, among other fields.
 
See what COMM Studies alumni are doing.
THE COMMUNICATION STUDIES CURRICULUM
Recently redesigned for the needs of today's college student, our curriculum teaches
 flexible knowledge and skills that transfer to a variety of settings. We are committed
 to preparing you not only for a career, but a lifetime of learning.
 
Our focus areas allow you to explore your interests in communication in depth. Whether
 you want to learn how people form relationships and work in groups (Professional &
 Relational Communication), how citizens and politicians argue and advocate to solve
 problems and advance causes (Rhetoric & Public Advocacy), or how film, television,
 and new media shape our identities and society (Media & Society), we have a course
 of study just for you!
