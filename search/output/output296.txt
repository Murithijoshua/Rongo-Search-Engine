Making a difference.
Sustainability. Climate Change. Green. Reduce – Reuse – Recycle.
 These slogans are familiar to all of us. The global community we have today is opening
 up some new challenges. Improvements in technology, and its widespread availability,
 have led to improved conditions for many people, worldwide. At the same time, those
 opportunities have begun to stretch resource usage to unsustainable limits. Where
 does the line get drawn?
 
 Environmental Studies is an opportunity for all students -- a chance to plug into
 a program that is going to help you be a global partner in the key issues of the 21st
 century.
