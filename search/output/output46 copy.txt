Music Education (Instrumental or Choral)

Learn to teach music effectively to every child, regardless of gender, race, ethnic
 origin, socioeconomic status or ability.

Program Description
It is our mission to help outstanding students become excellent music educators.
Music teacher education at the University of Memphis is based on one important yet
 simple premise: every child, regardless of background or circumstances, should have
 the best possible musical experiences in school and in their community. To that end,
 it is our objective to instill in the prospective educator the ability to teach music
 effectively to every child regardless of gender, race, ethnic origin, socioeconomic
 status, or ability. Our approach blends cutting-edge research insights and practical
 teaching techniques, encouraging students to seek, evaluate, and appropriately implement
 proven strategies and new innovations in music teaching and learning. We take pride
 in the warm, family-like atmosphere we cultivate among participants in our degree
 programs. 
Our undergraduate program exposes students to a variety of teaching techniques, learning
 structures, and academic environments through hands-on field experiences (preschool
 through secondary level) and a year-long residency (student teaching) internship.
 Students can choose a choral or instrumental (winds, brass, percussion, strings) emphasis, and we also welcome students who specialize
 in popular, indigenous, and/or digital music-making. Our Master's degrees are primarily
 designed for practicing music educators who wish to further their studies, refine
 their teaching approaches, and develop skills in research. We are proud to offer both an Online Master of Music in Music Education and the nation's
 only Master of Music in Orff Schulwerk. We also collaborate with the College of Education to offer the Master of Arts in
 Teaching, which is designed for students who have already earned a Bachelor's degree
 in music but need teaching licensure. Last, we are the only university in Tennessee that offers a Doctor of Philosophy in
 Music Education, which prepares advanced students to become researchers, music teacher educators,
 and leaders at the state, national, and international level. You can read more about our graduate programs here.
