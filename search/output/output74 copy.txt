Curriculum
The International and Global Studies program provides the opportunity to bring the
 knowledge of several traditional disciplines to bear upon a focal point of human relationships
 and problems that cross national and cultural boundaries.  Our program serves students
 seeking an understanding of the diverse national perspectives on the challenges confronting
 today's globalized society.
 
The program objectives are to:

(a) learn key issues of contention related to the international system;

(d) be able to conduct and present scholarly research on international issues;
