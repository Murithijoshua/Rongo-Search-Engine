 	BFA in Photography


Art – Photography, B.F.A.
Our program is the leading professional undergraduate/graduate fine art photography
 program in Tennessee and the seven surrounding Mid-American states. With the region's
 largest photography faculty — consisting of three full-time nationally known photographers,
 several part-time professional teachers, and a full-time experienced photo technician
 — our students receive individual attention and in-depth instruction. Our well-equipped
 facilities include separate black & white labs, color print lab, alternative process
 lab, electronic arts lab, and studio lighting facilities.
 
Students in our photography program have a spirit of togetherness, which creates a
 positive, friendly place to study. Their active student group, the Photographic Society,
 plans activities that include a yearly lecture series of internationally known photographers,
 travel, field trips, special workshops, group exhibitions, and parties. These events
 provide opportunities to make connections with leading photographers.
 
Students prepare for careers in fine art photography (b&w, color, alternative process,
 digital photography, and mixed media), documentary, freelance editorial, commercial/advertising,
 portrait, and fashion photography, as well as teaching.
 
The program's educational philosophy maintains that the photographer needs first to
 discover his or her personal vision, followed by amplification of his/her uniqueness
 within a fine arts education. Our fine arts approach, coupled with a strong technical
 base, provides the foundation for artistic discovery in photography: it frees students
 to explore their own direction in photography.
 
Later, as an advanced undergraduate or graduate student, you work closely with several
 faculty on independent self-assigned projects that strengthen your personal approach.
 This independent work becomes the key transition to a self-sufficient professional
 career in photography.
