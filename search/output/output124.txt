MA in COMM
Communication Studies Concentration
Students in the Communication Studies concentration receive advanced scholarly training
 in preparation for positions in industry, government, healthcare, or non-profit sectors,
 or for entry into a PhD program.
 
See what Communication Studies MA alumni are doing.
Film & Video Production Concentration
The concentration in Film and Video production combines technical instruction with
 courses in both motion picture and traditional communication studies to provide students
 with the knowledge and tools necessary to function in the multifaceted world of audiovisual
 production. The approach to media practice is broad enough to address the needs of
 the independent artist, as well as those who seek to enter the industry.

PROGRAM BASICS
Upon admission to the Master's program, students are advised by the Graduate Studies
 Coordinator until they choose a major advisor, convene a committee, and submit a Plan
 of Study for approval. Students work closely with their advisory committee to form
 a plan appropriate to the student's scholarly goals. The plan spells out the student's
 area of research and creative emphasis, lists the courses that s/he will take, and
 offers a timetable for completing the MA. Students in the general Communication concentration
 must complete at least 30 hours of coursework (10 classes) for the MA.
 
If in lieu of a thesis the student elects to complete the degree by taking comprehensive
 exams, the degree requires at least 33 hours (11 classes) of coursework. The Film
 and Video production concentration requires all students to complete a culminating
 project.
 
Full-time students typically spend about two years to earn the MA. Obviously, this
 varies depending on the student's success in moving through each stage of the program.

 and University rules that govern our program, click on the Key Policies and Documents
