We understand that you've got questions about college after military service. If you
 have family members attending UofM, you want them to get maximum support on campus.
 There's a lot of ground to cover, but you're not alone. Many of us have walked in
 your shoes. We've learned the ropes, and if we don't know something, our campus partners
 do. The military prepared you to be mission focused and persevere. Team VMSS is with
 you each step of the way!
 

"I can't contain my excitement. I accepted a position as a Hardware Electrical Engineer
 at GM. I want to thank the people who supported me through the most difficult times
 of my life from my time in the army till now…I want to thank the staff at VMSS for
 guiding me through school and life. Yes, I did the work, but without the help of others
 I do not know where I would be." 
- Electrical Engineering Major (U.S. Army Veteran)
