Music History

Study the history of Western classical art music, from early Medieval and Renaissance
 through the 21st century.

Program Description
The rich history of music is a vital part of study at the Scheidt School. We offer
 a Bachelor of Music degree in music history, combining practical study of music with
 academic courses in music history, music theory, and the liberal arts, and Master
 of Music and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in musicology for the most advanced students. Our
 focus is mostly historical, with a strong element of early-music performance and an
 active Collegium Musicum exploring early and under-served repertories, but courses
 in world music and local traditions are also offered. All courses in the area are
 open to all music majors, and students in the music history and musicology programs
 may participate in applied lessons and ensembles upon audition.  
 
Meet the faculty members that students learn and study with while earning their degree. 
Degrees offered

Bachelor of Music: Music History
Master of Music: Musicology
Doctoral: Musicology
