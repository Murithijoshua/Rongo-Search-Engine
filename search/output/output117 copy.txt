Engineering Technology Programs
Engineering Technology programs focuses on the application of engineering theory (as
 opposed to the development of theory). Using knowledge of mathematics and natural
 science, engineering technology is devoted to implementation and extension of existing
 technology for the benefit of humanity.
 
Career Outlook
ET students gravitate toward careers on the applied side of engineering, like Carrier
 Corp, Smith & Nephew, Wright Medical, Medtronic, FedEx, International Paper, AutoZone,
 ThyssenKrupp Elevator, Tennessee Valley Authority, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Parker
 Hannifin, Baptist Memorial Health Care Corporation, MLGW and Goodyear Tire & Rubber.
 
Engineering Technology Degree vs. Traditional Engineering Degree
What is the difference between an ET degree and an engineering degree? Graduates from
 our engineering programs are called engineers, but when you graduate from our engineering
 technology program, you are called a technologist. Traditional engineering tracks
 focus on theory and conceptual design, while ET is primarily focused on application
 and implementation. Math coursesin the ET program are lower level and more practical in nature, like algebra, trigonometry
 and applied calculus. Traditional engineering requires higher-level mathematics, including
 additional semesters of calculus and calculus based theoretical science courses.
