With its emphases on translational research and emerging public health issues, the
 PhD program in Epidemiology and Biostatistics offers a cutting-edge, advanced training
 to prepare individuals for academic and research careers. The program has two concentrations,
 Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Main areas of research include cardiovascular disease
 risk factors, allergic diseases and underlying genetic/epigenetic mechanisms, sickle
