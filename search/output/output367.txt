Master's Degree in Health Promotion
 
A UofM Global program
The master's degree in Health Promotion is a fully online, 30-credit-hour program
 which emphasizes the practical application of health promotion methods supported by
 theoretical foundations, relevant research and best practices. Health Promotion students
 must complete an applied project grounded in the practical application of health promotion
 methods and a comprehensive examination. Resident students may apply for a graduate
 assistantship.
 
The program examines the various factors responsible for the adoption and maintenance
 of health-related behaviors and identifies best practices for promoting the adoption
 and maintenance of healthy lifestyle behavors across a variety of settings. Upon graduating,
 you will be able to design, implement, manage and evaluate health promotion programs
 in settings such as governmental agencies, HMOs, hospitals, schools, colleges and
 universities, nonprofit organizations, and private enterprises such as business and
 industry. Our graduates have accepted positions as program directors at private and
 government agencies, senior research assistants in hospitals and education arenas,
 and corporate and community fitness and wellness leaders.
 
Background of Candidates
As an interdisciplinary discipline, health promotion students have a wide variety
 of undergraduate degrees including medicine, nursing, nutrition, exercise physiology,
 health education, communications, journalism, public relations, nutrition, sociology,
 psychology and other behavioral/social sciences. The common interest of this diverse
 group lies in three essential pillars of health promotion:
 

behavior change
health promotion and education
health science

We invite applications from students who wish to emphasize applied work in health
 promotion. You must have a minimum of a bachelor's degree and some coursework in the
 biological and behavior/social sciences. Applicants will be selected for admission
 to the program on the basis of grade point average, narrative statement and career
 goals, letters of reference and prior experience.
