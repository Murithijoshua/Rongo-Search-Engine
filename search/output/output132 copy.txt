Civil Engineering Programs
Civil Engineering serves the general public by planning, designing and constructing projects to safeguard
 our way of life. Civil engineers are big picture thinkers, involved in things that
 most people take for granted, like safe bridges that can withstand earthquakes, ways
 to clean waste water and reduce air pollution, improved roadway designs that flow
 smoothly with limited congestion, and safe paths for children to take to and from
 school.
 
Career Outlook
Our graduates can be found all over the world, working at all levels in the government
 and with consulting firms, the aerospace industry, major computer manufacturers and
 construction companies. Many go on to own engineering firms or hold top management
 positions. This degree path provides a broad background in engineering principles,
 which opens doors to all kinds of careers—our graduates are designing and planning
 in every field you can imagine throughout the private sector and in government.
