 	BFA in Theatre – Musical Theatre

Musical Theatre

 
 
The professional coursework in the Musical Theatre program includes intensive studies
 in Dance (ballet, tap, musical theatre styles), Theatre (acting, history, technical
 production), Music (voice, piano, theory), and Musical Theatre (performance, history
 and more). The liberal arts coursework includes required studies in college-level
 writing, literature, social sciences, math and the natural sciences. Academic and
 professional electives are required and most students choose to graduate with more
 than the minimum required coursework in order to explore other areas of interest.
It is our goal to teach students the skills necessary to be successful in the popular
 and competitive professional musical theatre world. To develop that skill-set, students
 receive a broad education in all three areas of Music, Theatre and Dance. More importantly,
 in musical theatre one is called upon to use all three of these areas together at
 any given moment in performance. Therefore, additional training is given in Musical
 Theatre specifically to help students learn how to use all three of these areas together
 in the particular genre that is the American Musical. As part of the degree, students
 also have opportunities to learn about career strategies, audition techniques and
 a wide array of performance skills.
