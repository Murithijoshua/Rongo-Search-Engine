Mechanical Engineering
Mechanical engineering ranges from basic research to product development to marketing
 launches of products that make life better every day. From transportation (trains,
 planes, automobiles) to entertainment (TVs, earbuds, gameplayers), from computers
 to the products you use routinely in life—these things were made possible by mechanical
 engineers. Are you curious about how to build safer and more efficient cars? Or how
 to make smaller machines than we have ever built before? Or about how to replace old,
 polluting, expensive energy systems with clean, reliable, sustainable energy systems?
 Then you are curious about mechanical engineering. Mechanical engineering deals with
 the development of machinery and tools and provides graduates with one of the broadest
 skill sets in engineering.
 
CAREER OUTLOOK
Herff prepares our students for careers ranging from transportation to aerospace and
 defense to manufacturing and processing. Many mechanical engineers work in professional
 office settings. Many also frequently visit worksites, work in production environments
 and even travel around the world. Our graduates work for companies, the government
 and not-for-profits in a wide variety of roles, including research, development, design,
 testing and marketing. Many become leaders.
