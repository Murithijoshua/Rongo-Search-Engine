Helping you Help your Student!
Welcome University of Memphis parents and families! These pages are designed for the
 parents and families of current and future students. We hope that you will find all
 the information you need to help you help your student during their time at the University of Memphis. The mission of Parent & Family Services
 is to support, inform and engage parents with the University of Memphis community;
 to advocate for family involvement in order to promote student development and student
 success, and to provide opportunities for parents and families to connect with the
 Tiger experience. 
 
In addition to the website, please feel free to call us at any time with any questions,
 comments, or concerns you may have, from a hotel recommendation to help with your
 student's financial aid package. We are just an e-mail (parents@memphis.edu) or phone call (901.678.2115) away. We look forward to meeting and assisting you
 in the coming years.
 
Tiger Talks
Tiger Talk is an interactive resource designed to help you connect with faculty, staff,
 and students and answer some of your questions about the University of Memphis. To
 participate in Tiger Talk, you can go to our YouTube or Facebook to watch the live
 premiers. You can also watch previously recorded videos in our YouTube Library.
