 		M.A. Program
 

Welcome to Our Graduate Program
We have master's program with four emphases—Integrated Strategic Media, News and Storytelling, Visual Media and Mass Media Research. Students choose an emphasis to guide the courses they take.
 
We are a great home for individuals who want to improve their skills in journalism,
 advertising, public relations, strategic communication and visual media. Our courses
 are also grounded in the theories and practices of today's mass media. Students are
 then expected to apply that theory while learning practical skills, such as creating
 multimedia projects, developing cutting-edge audience research, crafting effective
 crisis messaging and perfecting a story pitch.
 
Our courses are offered both online and on campus, so students regardless of their
 time zone can take classes. We also offer 3 graduate certificates: Entrepreneurial Journalism, where students work with faculty and the Crews Center for Entrepreneurship to learn
 more about the realities and abilities of creating a startup business, with the chance
 to pitch and promote their ideas to funders and other entrepreneurs in Memphis and
 the Mid-South; Multimedia Storytelling, where students gain the technical expertise needed to create multimedia projects
 and the reporting and storytelling skills needed to create compelling content in today's
 media market; and Social Media Analysis and Strategies, where students gain the knowledge of how to use social media, how to engage the public,
 and how to analyze the information social media provides in order to improve performance
 and understanding.
 
Whether you're a prospective student, a current student or someone looking for a great
 opportunity to build skills and a professional network at the same time, the Department
 of Journalism and Strategic Media is the place to be. Feel free to contact us with
 any questions you have about the program and what it can do for you. We look forward
 to working with you.
