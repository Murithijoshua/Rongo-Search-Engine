About the Graduate Program
The Department of Sociology at the University of Memphis offers graduate studies leading
 to the Master of Arts in Sociology. Training in theory, research methods, and statistics
 is required of all students. In addition, the program offers a wide selection of courses
 in many substantive areas such as race, class and gender studies; globalization and
 development; social change; family; deviance; religion, and medical sociology.
 
The Master's program provides opportunities to develop skills and interests in specific
 specialty areas while obtaining a solid grounding in sociological theory and social
 research methods. The program offers a high level of student-faculty interaction and
 the opportunity to participate in supervised research. The exposure to a full range
 of sociological specialties allows our M.A. graduates to apply to and be accepted
 by a wide range of Ph.D. programs. It is also appropriate for students who want to
 work in areas of applied research.
 
There are two degree options available to students pursuing the M.A. in sociology
 - a thesis program (24 hours of graduate course work plus 6 hours of credit for writing
 a thesis) or a non-thesis program (33 hours of graduate course work with both written
 and oral comprehensive examinations that cover sociological theory, research methods
 and statistics, and a substantive area selected by the student).
