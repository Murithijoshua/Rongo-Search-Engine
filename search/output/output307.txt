Traditions and cultures, east and west, ancient and modern
Religious Studies explores a broad spectrum of religious traditions and cultures,
 east and west, ancient and modern. Students will examine religion outside the framework
 of any particular belief system and negotiate the tension between the perspective
 of faith and the demands of scholarship.
 
To understand other cultures, as well as our own history, it is crucial to appreciate
 the religious influences that have shaped much of the world's literature, politics,
 art, and economics. Consequently, the study of religion is an exciting intellectual
 endeavor – cross-cultural in content and multidisciplinary in approach – seeking to
 engage the critical issues of religion in their many facets: historical, textual,
 cultural, sociological, experiential, and philosophical. Religious pluralism plays
 an important role in teaching the value of diversity, thus Religious Studies Minor
 will bring a broad range of perspectives into the study.
 
The program is designed for students with a diversity of backgrounds and interests
 and will complement related coursework undertaken in a broad range of academic disciplines.
 "Introduction to Religion" and "Perspectives on Religion," provide students with an
 appreciation of the variety of religious experiences and actions of humanity, and
 knowledge of the basic approaches used to study religion. Elective courses offered
 in several departments across campus permit students to further develop interests,
 by exploring particular religious traditions and ways of studying religion. The Senior
 Capstone Project integrates previous coursework and can be coordinated with other
 course work, through arrangement with an appropriate faculty sponsor and approval
 of the program coordinator.
