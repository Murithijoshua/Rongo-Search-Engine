 due to the COVID-19 crisis. Types of expenses include but are not limited to:
 


Technology/connectivity to aid in remote learning
Assistance with housing/rent/utilities

 food insecurity on campus. It is open to current University of Memphis students and
 generally carries non-perishable food items, basic toiletries, and basic household
 items.
