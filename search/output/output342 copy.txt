Develop your voice and discover techniques for composing for orchestra, voice, and
 chamber ensembles through contemporary, jazz, and film music genres.

Program Description
Scheidt School of Music offers Bachelors (BM), Masters (MM) and Doctorate (DMA) degrees
 in Composition. All composition classes from bachelor's to Doctorate levels are once
 a week individual lessons. Considered a part of every composition class is a weekly
 seminar with all the composition students in attendance, where new concert works are
 heard, and aesthetic and technical issues are discussed that concerns the past fifty
 years.
 
Composition students enjoy the opportunity of having their works performed by our
 major ensembles, including the University of Memphis Symphony Orchestra, Wind Ensemble,
 University Singers, and Contemporary Chamber Players. Our Composition division traditionally
 hosts two national/international guest composers each year.
 
We offer a full array of undergraduate and graduate level music theory courses, from
 the standard four-semester undergraduate sequence to upper division analysis courses,
 to graduate courses covering all aspects of analytical processes and specialty composer-oriented
 analysis courses.
