 	Performance Major

Classical Performance

Includes voice, piano, collaborative piano, strings, woodwinds, multiple woodwind
 instrument performance, brass, and percussion.

Program Description
A performance major is a student primarily focused on the mastery of their primary

 opera, and classical chamber music. Students can major in performance while pursuing
 the Bachelor of Music degree, the Master of Music degree, or the Doctor of Musical
 Arts degree.
 
Over the course of the degree, students will work closely with their major teacher,
 who acts as a mentor and gateway to future professional opportunities. The performance
 major must give multiple recitals as part of their degree plan. Performance majors
 play flute, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, bassoon, percussion, trumpet, French horn,
 trombone, euphonium, tuba, piano, harpsichord, organ, violin, viola, cello, bass,
 guitar, or voice. 
 
Performance majors are not required to play in marching band at the University of
 Memphis.
