B.S. Computer ScienceCybersecurity Concentration
 
Cybersecurity is an increasingly relevant field in today's world. In her September 2016 remarks, U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker indicated that employers nationwide face
 a shortfall of over 200,000 cybersecurity specialists.
 
The U of M has long been at the forefront of cybersecurity research. Our Center for Information Assurance has received millions of dollars in research grants, and we are designated as a National
 Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education and Research (CAE-CDE, CAE-R) by the NSA/DHS.
 
Since Fall 2017, we have been excited to bring our expertise to undergraduate students
 with a cybersecurity concentration for the B.S. degree.  Students in this concentration
 take 12 hours of cybersecurity-oriented coursework.  For the latest requirements,
 please refer to the Undergraduate Catalog.
