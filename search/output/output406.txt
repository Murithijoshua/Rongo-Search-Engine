MFA in Creative Writing
The Creative Writing MFA brings together nationally recognized authors and a diverse,
 carefully selected group of students in one of the most culturally rich cities in
 the country. Graduates of the program have gone on to publish books, win awards, and
 teach in universities around the country. Students work in small groups with faculty
 to study fiction, creative nonfiction, poetry, or a mix of all three. Students may
 also have opportunities to teach creative writing locally and abroad.
 
In addition to their coursework, MFA students help run the River City Writers Series, one of the oldest and most prestigious series of its kind. They also staff The Pinch, an award-winning literary journal distributed nationally twice a year.

What Do Our Graduates Have to Say?
"The program helped me understand the process of being an active writer: setting my
 own writing schedule, sending out submissions, and being an active part of the literary
 community. As a result, I've been published in around thirty different journals and
 served as the inaugural Artist in Residence at the Brooks Museum."
 
- Jonathan May, MFA
 
"Six of the ten stories included in my thesis have either been published or are under
 contract by journals. The collection is under contract with Unsolicited Press and
 is scheduled for release in November 2017 . . . I have taken a position at Fayetteville
 Tech in North Carolina as an English Instructor, where I teach Creative Writing, Literature,
 and Composition. I am a co-advisor for Sigma Kappa Delta, the English honors society,
 and Managing Editor for Unbound, an award winning literary arts journal."
