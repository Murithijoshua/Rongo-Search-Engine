Undergraduate Information
Selecting courses, advising prior to registration, providing information regarding
 college and university requirements, transfer programs, and guiding students along
 the path to graduation and beyond are just a few of the services provided by the Biology Advising and Resource Center (BARC).   All Biology  majors that have completed CHEM 1110/1111 should come to the BARC for
 advising, unless they have arranged for a faculty advisor.  Students that have not
 yet successfully passed CHEM 1110/1111 are generally seen by advisors in the ACC-Academic Counseling Center.
 
All students should come to the BARC for general information on Biology Permits, Degree
 Requirements, and Career Information.
 

Biology Major (B.S.)
Students who earn a B.S. in Biology should attain the following objectives: (a) possession
 of a fundamental understanding of biology spanning from the subcellular to the ecosystem
 level; (b) the ability to compete successfully for admission to graduate and professional
 programs and for entry level employment that utilizes the knowledge and training acquired
 during their academic program; (c) development of skills in analysis, synthesis, and
 quantitative reasoning that are essential in hypothesis testing, critical thinking,
 interpretation of scientific data, and written and oral communication.
