Undergraduate Program
The Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology is designed to achieve several broad objectives:
 to increase students' understanding of their cultural and natural worlds through greater
 familiarity with the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences; to enhance
 their skills in communication, quantitative analysis, and critical reasoning; and
 to prepare them to fulfill their roles as responsible members of their families, community,
 and society.
 
More specifically, the psychology degree program introduces students to the theoretical
 and empirical literatures of psychology; teaches them the skills necessary to advance
 the science of psychology; and encourages them to apply the principles of psychology
 to the improvement of human welfare.
 
The undergraduate degree program is designed to assist students in reaching five major
 goals:
 
Goal 1. Knowledge Base of Psychology
Describe key concepts, overarching themes, content domains, and various applications
 of psychology.
 
Goal 2. Scientific Inquiry and Critical Thinking
Understand and apply basic research methods in psychology while using scientific reasoning,
 problem solving, and psychology information literacy.
 
Goal 3. Ethical and Social Responsibility in a Diverse World
Understand and embrace values that lead to ethically and and socially responsible
 behaviors that are sensitive to increasing diversity in the workplace and the community.
 
Goal 4. Communication
Demonstrate competence in written, oral, and interpersonal communication skills.
Goal 5. Professional Development
Apply psychological content knowledge and skills that will increase readiness for
 postbaccalaureate employment, graduate school, or professional school.
 
In this area of the Psychology Department website you will find answers to some frequently
 asked questions about getting a degree in psychology, information about Subject Pool
