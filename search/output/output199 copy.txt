Empowering Research Across Campus 
The Division of Research and Innovation serves researchers in every department on
 campus in their mission to grow the impact of research. Regardless of discipline,
 we believe that every faculty member is capable of finding funding and achieving national
 visibility for their work. Our office includes Research Development, Sponsored Programs,
 Research Compliance, Office of Technology Transfer, the FedEx Institute of Technology,
 and Animal Care Services. 
 
For Researchers
From strategic discussions and finding funding, to submitting proposals and patenting
 inventions, the first stop for all researchers on our campus is the Researchers site.

 and nurture the growth of research across the UofM. Each community is comprised of
 faculty representing multiple disciplines, perspectives and research approaches with
 a shared interest in exploring a common research theme. Learn more about the CoRS awardees.
