Office of Sponsored Programs
The Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) partners with faculty and staff to provide
 the highest quality research administration at all stages of sponsored projects, from
 identifying funding sources through award closeout. OSP facilitates the scholarly
 activities of the research community as it positions the University to become the
 leading public research institution in the nation. The easiest way to reach us is
 via e-mail to OSP@memphis.edu. Your message will be acknowledged within 24 hours with an answer or with a timeline
 for when you can expect one. All team members receive messages sent to this address,
 thus reducing the risk of delay due to staff being out of the office or under heavy
 deadlines.
 
Research Compliance
The Research Compliance department includes The Institutional Review Board (IRB) and
 Financial Conflict of Interests, Export Controls and Animal Care. The IRB is charged
 with the responsibility of reviewing, prior to its initiation, all research (whether
 funded or not) involving human participants. The IRB is concerned with protecting
 the welfare, rights, and privacy of human subjects. The IRB has the authority to approve,
 disapprove, monitor, and require modifications in all research activities that fall
 within its jurisdiction as specified by both the federal regulations and institutional
 policy. Federal regulations, state laws and University policies recognize that researchers
 may have financial interests in research sponsors and/or in entities with business
 interests closely related to their research. In order to ensure that all employees
 engaging in sponsored research recognize, manage and report financial conflicts of
 interest, annual disclosure is required, and CITI training is required prior to engaging
 in sponsored research.
