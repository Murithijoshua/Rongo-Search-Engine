Focusing on scholarship of women and gender
Women's and Gender Studies at the University of Memphis is an academic program that
 focuses on the scholarship of women and gender, and how we think about race, class,
 sexuality and social inequality. Our interdisciplinary program offers an undergraduate
 minor and a graduate certificate.
 
WOMEN’S AND GENDER STUDIES, FALL 2021 (subject to change)
Since Women's and Gender Studies is an interdisciplinary program, not a department,
 we draw most of our courses from departments throughout the University. Please check
 with individual departments for further information on these courses, and verify meeting
 times through the online course scheduling system. If you have questions about courses
 not listed here, please contact the Director of Women's and Gender Studies, Dr. Kathy Schultz klschltz@memphis.edu.
