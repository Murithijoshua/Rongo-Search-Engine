Official Transcript
Electronic transcripts can be ordered 24/7 using TranscriptsPlus and are the quickest
 method for receiving/delivering transcripts.  
 




Current Students
Login to the myMemphis portal. >

Go to your “Student” page, and and click on the Official Transcript link in the Registration
 and Records portlet. Because you have logged in, you will not be required to submit
 additional authorization.
 



Former Students
Use Transcript Ordering Services. >

Since you are not being authenticated through the portal, you will be asked to complete
 and submit a FERPA release form before you can complete a transcript request. 
 



TranscriptsPlus charges $2.85 per transcript requested. For more information, visit
 our TranscriptsPlus FAQ page. 
 
Other Request Methods
Our office also accepts transcript requests made in these ways:

In Person at the Registrar’s Office Front Counter. Same day service is available for
 many in-person requests if the request is made by 2:30 pm. Please be sure to have
 your photo ID with you.
 
Postal mail using the Off-Campus Transcript Request Form. Mailed transcript requests should be processed and mailed out within 1-3 business
 days.
 

Fees
A request made in person or by mail is free unless you request more than 20 transcripts
 in the same order. Each copy over 20 costs $5.00 and you must submit either an In-office Excess Transcripts Charge form or an Off–campus Excess Transcript Charge form with the request.
 
 Questions?
Visit the Transcripts and Grades FAQ page for more information.
 
Notes for All Request Methods

Holds - To receive a transcript, your UofM account must be free of financial obligations
 and any holds that would prevent your requesting a transcript. View information on holds.
Enclosures - Provide/include any enclosures that are to accompany your transcript.
 
Issued to Student - Any transcript released directly to you will have ISSUED TO STUDENT stamped or
 printed on it.
 
UofM Graduate School - UofM undergraduates applying to UofM Graduate School do not need to request an
 official transcript: the Graduate School has access to your undergraduate transcripts.
 
Graduating Students - If you are graduating from UofM during the current term, your transcript will not
 be available from the first day of final exams until your degree has been awarded.
 Once your degree has been posted to your transcript, any transcript request will be
 processed immediately.
