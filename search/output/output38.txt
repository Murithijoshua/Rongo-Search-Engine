About the BFA
The Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) Degree in Design & Technical Production at the University
 of Memphis is a program specifically designed for students whose interests and abilities
 strongly suggest potential for pursuing careers as artists for the professional theatre
 and entertainment industries. The curriculum is structured to introduce students to
 all aspects of theatre while growing towards a specialization. Students learn from
 dedicated faculty, often as apprentices, and have ample opportunities to produce realized
 work. The variety and nature of the resources available to student artists are of
 professional caliber, allowing the motivated student to develop the skills necessary
 for a career in theatre.
 
The Curriculum
The Department of Theatre & Dance launched a new, comprehensive design curriculum,
 in the Fall of 2017, with the goal of matching skills to industry expectations and
 the growing role that technology will play in the 21st century. The design pedagogy
 at The University of Memphis fosters the development of our students on an individual
 basis, allowing each student develop a designer's eye and the craft skills necessary
 to creating professional level productions. Smaller class sizes provide students individual
 attention to help develop an effective design process, engage advanced technology
 and determine the most appropriate design tools for a given project. Production opportunities
 in our performance spaces extend the classroom experience; linking process with practice.
 
Professional Connections
All design and technology students are required to complete a professional internship
 prior to graduation. Our students have connected with professional theatre companies
 across the country. Through these connections, students begin to develop a professional
 network. In addition, there are opportunities to work within the Memphis theatre community.
 All students are expected to develop a portfolio suitable for consideration for professional
 employment or application to a Masters of Fine Arts program. Students are provided
 feedback on their progress through an annual portfolio review and advising.
 
Transfer Students
Transfer students are admitted to the program throughout the year, through scheduled
 interviews each semester. However, they must complete all of the program requirements.Summary of Curriculum RequirementsGeneral Education Requirements – 41 credit hoursTheatre & Dance Core – 11 credits hoursD&T Concentration Core – 36 credit hoursDesign Courses – 16 credit hoursTechnology Courses – 10 credit hoursTheatre & Free Electives – 6 credit hoursTotal: 120 credit hours
