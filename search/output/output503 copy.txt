Doctor of Philosophy in Social and Behavioral Sciences (PhD)

The Social and Behavioral Sciences doctoral program is based on the principle that
 health and health behaviors are influenced by multiple psychological, behavioral,
 social and cultural factors. This program is designed for master's prepared students
 who seek advanced training in social and behavioral science theories and methods.
 Due to the complex challenges of population health and healthcare delivery, the need
 for public health scholars with expertise in social and behavioral sciences continues
 to grow in academia, research, and practice. This CEPH-accredited interdisciplinary
 doctoral program is intended to be completed in three to four years. Students work
 closely with faculty mentors in research areas such as smoking, substance abuse, nutrition,
 physical activity, obesity, cancer, HIV/AIDS, STDs, and neighborhood environment.
 As a metropolitan research university, we are especially committed to health equity
 and social justice issues in urban communities. There are several competitive assistantships
 available with full tuition waiver and a $16,500 annual stipend.
 
Program Highlights
Graduates of the PhD program will be prepared to: 

Conduct innovative, multidisciplinary, and translational research in community settings;
Rigorously design, implement, and evaluate public health interventions and policies;
Become involved with community-based projects, large cohort studies, and clinical
 trials; and
 
Work with dedicated, expert mentors on collaborative projects and publications. View Curriculum >
