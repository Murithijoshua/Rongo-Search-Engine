MA in TESOL
Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages
Students in the TESOL concentration follow an integrated program of study that helps
 them develop expertise in areas such as second language acquisition, cross-cultural
 communication, language structure, and instructional methodology. Besides developing
 skills in analyzing language, assessing language ability, and planning language instruction,
 students apply their knowledge through practical experiences in the U.S. and abroad.
 
While pursuing their degrees, graduate students have taught English abroad in the
 Czech Republic, China, Korea, and in Japan. Students have also presented papers at
 professional conferences such as The Southeastern Conference on Linguistics, NWAVE,
 Tennessee TESOL, and International TESOL. TESOL students also are active in the Greater
 Memphis community, tutoring and teaching individuals and small groups. After graduation,
 employment opportunities include teaching in the U.S. and abroad in various programs
 in ESL and Linguistics.
 
The University of Memphis offers an M.A. with a concentration in TESOL or a graduate
 certificate program in Teaching English as a Second/Foreign Language. These degrees
 require courses in Linguistics as well as in TESOL. It is also possible to earn an
 M.A. in TESOL completely online.
