 	Department of Communication PhD Program

PhD in COMM

The PhD program trains students mainly for careers in higher education, though some
 COMM PhDs have also gone on to work in positions outside of academia. The program
 is marked by curricular flexibility and a commitment to supporting students as they
 work to become leaders in the field. Under close faculty supervision, students take
 courses within Communication and in other disciplines as they build expertise in an
 area of specialization and prepare their dissertation.

Program Basics
Upon admission to the Doctoral program, students are advised by the Director of Graduate
 Studies until they choose a major advisor, convene a committee, and submit a Plan
 of Study for approval. Students work closely with their advisory committee to form
 a plan appropriate to the student's scholarly goals. The plan spells out the student's
 area of research emphasis, describes a dissertation topic, lists the courses that
 s/he will take, and offers a timetable for completion.
 
Students must complete 36 hours of doctoral-level coursework (12 classes) before moving
 on to their comprehensive examinations, which are administered by the advisory committee
 and tailored to the student's research interests. Upon successful completion of their
 exams, students submit their dissertation prospectus for committee approval. Upon
 approval of the prospectus, students begin writing their dissertation. Students earn
 the doctorate once their dissertation is approved by the full committee and the Graduate
 School.
 
Full-time students typically spend two years in coursework, one year taking exams
 and drafting their prospectus, and one year writing the dissertation. Obviously, this
 varies depending on the student's success in moving through each stage of the program.
