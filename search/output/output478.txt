UofM’s Sabri receives another patent featuring temperature sensing technology
Sabri’s invention currently orbiting earth on the International Space Station
May 26, 2021 — Dr. Firouzeh Sabri, professor and chair of Physics and Materials Sciences and FedEx
 Institute of Technology Biologistics Research Cluster fellow at the University of
 Memphis, recently received notification of a second patent for her research on temperature
 sensors. The patent, lightweight flexible temperature sensor kit, highlights technology
 for a reusable sensor that features a polymer temperature-sensing device resembling
 a band-aid and the temperatures can be read remotely, either in Celsius or Fahrenheit,
 through a wand.
 
Phosphor thermometry is one of the most accurate ways to assess and measure temperature.
 The use of this noninvasive and rapid temperature testing technique was hindered by
 the fact that phosphors are fine powders and as such their application range was severely
 limited.
 
In order to test the durability and tolerance of the polymer composites, Sabri’s invention
 is currently orbiting earth on the International Space Station. This is part of a
 $45,000 grant she received to test the effect of radiation and the temperatures extremes
 of space on the polymer patch.
 
The patent, issued to Sabri and Allison, chief scientific officer of Emerging Measurements,
 is for the design, testing and optimization of a polymer composite that can be safely
 reused and can be affixed to any surface for rapid non-invasive and accurate temperature
 evaluation. This binary system consists of the composite label and a “reader” wand
 that can interact with the label remotely. The composite is an inert material and
 is safe for a wide range of applications including the food and beverage industry,
 pharmaceuticals and many more. This invention offers a unique combination of characteristics
 that cannot be found in other temperature sensing systems currently on the market.
 The breadth of the temperature ranges that can be evaluated by means of this technology
 is beyond the capabilities of other temperature labels.
 
“There is no need to dispose, no need to worry about contamination. You can sterilize
 them, and it will not alter the properties, the behavior or the precision,” Sabri
 said. “We are excited about the future and are looking forward to licensing opportunities.”
 
This patent adds to the UofM patent repository and is currently being evaluated for
 licensing and commercialization opportunities.
