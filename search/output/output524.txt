Project Description: The UCI spring 2018 internship is a research and writing project. We have a project
 for an intern to provide us with more detailed information on the TN Commission on
 Children and Youth's Kids Count data report.  This report is published twice a year. 
 The most recent – spring 2017 –report ranked Shelby County as being at the very bottom
 of TN's 95 counties on several indicators of children's health and well-being.
 
We want an intern to research this and provide us with more detailed information on
 the nuances of this data.  And we also want the intern to review thoroughly what all
 is being done in Shelby County to address the deficiencies we have that cause us to
 rank so low.
 
The intern's responsibilities would be to attend staff meetings and to report on progress
 made on this particular project.  The intern might also be asked to attend other meetings
 and conferences – that would be great learning experiences.
 
Requirements for Student Applicants: Knowledge and skills in research techniques;Exceptional oral and written communication
 skills; Ability to synthesize data in both visual and written format; Enthusiasm for
 the research topic; Reliable transportation
 
Application or Interview Process: Submit cover letter with a brief description of how your coursework and experiences
 would be beneficial for this project and an unofficial transcript.
 
Hours/week and Start Date:  15-20 hours/week 
 
Method of Compensation: Volunteer
