Can you hear the roar?
It's loud and it's electric, really, what happens around town in support of the Memphis
 Tigers. To say that people are wild about our Tigers is a total understatement. Memphis
 loves the UofM and the UofM loves Memphis. We got married a long time ago. Memphis
 is a pick-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps kind of town, where people dare to be original.
 The UofM is a driven by doing kind of university where "stick-to-it-iveness" is a
 given. We don't stop. We keep at it. Push. Push harder. We are no strangers to March
 Madness or conference championships. Being in this city of doers, means we're the
 University that also knows how to do. We Tiger claw our way to the top.
 
And with 400 student-athletes competing in 19 different intercollegiate sports, there's
 a lot of room for doing. The UofM is a charter member of the American Athletic Conference
 and our athletic programs compete at the highest level as an NCAA Division I institution.
 It's the south, so athletics are big. But this is also Memphis, so athletics bring
 us together to be proud, eat some barbeque and have some good times. Then repeat often.
