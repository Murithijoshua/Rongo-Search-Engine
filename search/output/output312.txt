 Undergraduate Admission
Students should choose the application that best fits their intentions. Applications
 are generally available approximately one year before the term the student wishes
 to enter.  If you have ever applied to the University of Memphis and paid the application
 fee, but did not enroll at that time, complete the Returning Application.  If you
 have ever attended the University of Memphis and been absent at least one complete
 Spring or Fall semester, please apply using the Returning Application.  If you are
 currently enrolled at another post-secondary institution and plan to transfer your
 UofM course(s) back to that institution upon completion, please apply using the Transfer
