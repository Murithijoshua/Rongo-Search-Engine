Architecture Degree Programs
At The University of Memphis, the study of architecture and interior architecture
 encompasses both the art and science of design. The focus is on the education of the
 individual student through a well-rounded approach in a sequence of foundation courses,
 design studios, and professional/technical courses.  The program of study for each
 degree program is structured to engage students in the processes and professional
 standards of design and technology necessary for shaping the built environment. Students
 are placed at the center of discovery-based studies, and required to assume responsible
 participation in their studies.
 
Master of Architecture
The Master of Architecture is a professional degree accredited by the National Architectural
 Accrediting Board (NAAB) and meets the education requirements for registration as
 an architect in all US jurisdictions.  Please visit the page on accreditation for

 international students graduating from the programs to apply for an additional 24-month
 extension after their initial 12 month-long Optional Practical Training (OPT), with
 eligibility for a total of 36 months of practical training in the United States
