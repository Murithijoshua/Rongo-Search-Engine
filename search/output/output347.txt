BBA in Management
BBA degree with a Management major allows students to specialize in one of three emphasis
 areas: (1) Leadership and Organizations, (2) Human Resource Management, and (3) General
 Management. Each of these areas of emphasis allows students to focus their studies
 with a curriculum geared toward leadership and management success in an array of organizations
 and occupations.
 
Leadership and Organizations emphasis seeks to develop within students the leadership and management skills that
 can enhance their careers in businesses such as retail, healthcare, entertainment,
 and the services. The focus is on learning behavioral skills associated with leadership
 such as motivating others, building successful teams, communication and negotiation,
 as well as the traditional management skills of staffing, controlling, organizing,
 and rewarding.
 
Human Resource Management emphasis provides students with skills required for successful careers as human resource
 generalists and specialists. Students in this emphasis area take courses in basic
 and advanced human resource management covering topics such as employee recruitment
 and selection, training and development, performance management and appraisal, compensation
 and reward systems, and legal compliance.
 
General Management emphasis allows students to choose skill areas in which to focus, while also allowing
 them to focus on a technical specialty not covered in other areas. These specializations
 include transportation, not-for-profit, and more specialized business areas within
 the services, retail, and manufacturing areas. Students who are interested in entrepreneurship
 and innovation may also take this emphasis, while supplementing the management/leadership
 courses with courses from other areas that will facilitate success as a business owner.
