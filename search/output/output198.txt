 	BA in Art History


Art – Global Art Histories, B.A.
Art History at the University of Memphis is the study of art as both a reflection
 of culture and an active agent in shaping it. As such, painting, sculpture, architecture,
 photography, video, performance, mixed media, among other mediums, are understood
 to be intricately related to a broader cultural context including literature, philosophy,
 religion, politics, and science. Students are trained to closely analyze art and visual
 culture from an interdisciplinary perspective, taking into consideration the creative
 process, viewer reception, and artistic function.
 
The primary goal of the undergraduate B.A. program is two-fold: 1) to provide students
 with a general foundation of art historical knowledge from a global, multicultural
 perspective, beginning with the ancient worlds up to the present day; 2) produce graduates
 with the analytical training, writing skills, and research techniques necessary to
 pursue further graduate studies or a range of employment opportunities in education,
 museums, or arts organizations. With one of the largest art history faculties in the
 Southeast (nine Ph.D. faculty) offering a number of undergraduate and graduate courses,
 such as Greek and Roman Art, Visual Arts of Africa, Medieval Art, Art Theory and Criticism,
 Museum Studies, Egyptian Art and Architecture, Modern American Photography, Italian
 Renaissance Art, Realism and Impressionism, and Contemporary Folk Art, the Art History
 program at the University of Memphis ranks among the best in the region.
 
The program has been further distinguished among state institutions by awards of both
 a Chair of Excellence (the Dorothy Kayser Hohenberg Chair of Excellence in Art History, which provides us with a distinguished visiting scholar every year), and a Center
 of Excellence, the Institute of Egyptian Art and Archaeology, which supports the study
 of the art of Egypt with a substantial research library and object collection, as
 well as a distinguished faculty of five, making it one of the largest teaching programs
 in the U.S.
